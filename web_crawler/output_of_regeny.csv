Why do some charging stations charge extra fees?
EV charging station owners are the ultimate decision-makers to allow free charging or not.
There is a cost associated with installation and electricity. A few factors affecting the cost can be the location of the charging station, the speed of charging, and the local rules & regulations.
If youre charging your EV from a superior location such as a 5-star hotel the cost will be more compared to a residential complex charging station. Similarly, if a charging station offers high-speed EV charging, the cost is going to be more.
What do different colors mean on the map?
There are three different color codes represented on the map

Green Innovation Takes the Stage: COP28 UAE 2023
Anish Reddy
Events
Introduction
The United Arab Emirates, a nation renowned for its visionary approach to sustainable development, is poised to play a pivotal role in the upcoming Conference of the Parties (COP28) in 2023.
As a forward-thinking EV charger manufacturer and installation brand based in the UAE, Regeny is thrilled to see what this global event unfolds.
COP28 is a crucial milestone in the ongoing fight against climate change, and the UAEs commitment to climate action is a testament to its dedication to a more sustainable and environmentally responsible future.
The UAEs Remarkable Climate Commitment
The UAE has been a trailblazer in the realm of climate action. It holds the distinction of being the first country in the Middle East to ratify the Paris Agreement, the global treaty aimed at combating climate change. By taking this step, the UAE demonstrated its unwavering dedication to international efforts to mitigate the impact of climate change.
Furthermore, the UAE was the first in the region to commit to an economy-wide reduction in emissions. This commitment, outlined in its 2015 Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), sets a goal of reducing emissions by 2030. The NDC marked a significant milestone, as it showcased the UAEs proactive stance in the global fight against climate change.
The UAEs boldest move to date is its announcement of a Net Zero by 2050 strategic initiative, launched in November 2022. This initiative outlines a clear path to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. Such a commitment is a testament to the UAEs dedication to sustainability and its proactive approach to climate action.
Impressive NDC Revisions
Notably, the UAE was among the select group of nations that submitted a revised second NDC ahead of COP27. This revised target is expected to result in a substantial absolute emissions reduction of approximately 93.2 million metric tons of CO2e. These actions reflect the UAEs determination to continually raise the bar in its climate ambitions.
Key Agenda Items for COP28
COP28 is anticipated to be a landmark event with an agenda that includes several critical issues:
1. The First Global Stocktake
This process will evaluate the global progress in climate action and the efforts to achieve the goals set in the Paris Agreement.
2. The Mitigation Work Programme
A significant part of the COP28 discussions will focus on strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, a vital aspect of combating climate change.
3. The Global Goal on Adaptation
In a rapidly changing climate, adaptation is crucial. The UAEs participation in discussions on this topic underscores its commitment to preparing for the challenges ahead.
4. Climate Finance
COP28 will address the financial arrangements necessary for climate action, including financial mechanisms for Loss and Damage. The UAE recognizes the importance of providing financial support for developing countries to address climate change.
Regenys Initiative to Support Sustainability
At Regeny, we share the UAEs passion for sustainability and environmental stewardship. As an EV charger manufacturer and installation brand, we have long been at the forefront of the transition to electric mobility, a key pillar in reducing carbon emissions. We believe that sustainable practices and innovations play a vital role in achieving the goals set by the UAE and the international community.
Our presence at COP28 2023 signifies our commitment to contributing to the global conversation on climate action. We are proud to be a part of a nation that leads by example, and we look forward to showcasing our contributions and solutions that further advance the cause of sustainable transportation and infrastructure.
solutions
Conclusion
The UAEs remarkable track record on climate action is a testament to its leadership and commitment to a more sustainable and environmentally responsible future.
COP28, with its significant agenda items, is a crucial platform for nations and organizations like Regeny to collaborate and advance the global fight against climate change.
As we prepare to attend this momentous event, we stand proudly with the UAE in our shared dedication to sustainability, innovation, and a greener future for all.

This commitment plays a crucial role in reducing the carbon footprint of their developments while enhancing the quality of life for communities.

5 Reasons Why You Should Get An Electric Car In UAE  The Environment, Economics, Government Policies And More!
Anish Reddy
Electric Car
Do you ever wonder why there are so many gas stations and car dealerships on every street corner in the country? Well, theres a lot that goes into it. The automotive industry plays a massive role in the economy of any country, and the same is true for the UAE as well. In this article we will be taking a look at some of the major reasons why you should get an electric car in UAE.
The Environment
Electric cars, or EVs, are very good for the environment because they dont produce any emissions, and theyre much more efficient than regular cars. The production of electric cars causes much less damage to the environment than the production of gasoline-powered cars, and theyre much better for the ozone layer and climate. EV cars are also much safer than regular cars because theyre less likely to have an accident and are much safer for pedestrians and other people on the road.
Government Policies
The UAE government has made it a priority to encourage the use of EVs, and theyre offering a lot of great incentives to make it worth your while to get an electric car. The biggest incentive is the fact that you can get the same tax exemption thats offered to people who own gas-powered cars. This means that you can save a lot of money on tax every year, and thats a great incentive for most people. There are also a lot of other government policies that make it worth your while to get an EV. For instance, there are zero taxes on EV batteries, EV charging stations are free to use, and there are free parking spaces for EV drivers at most public parking spaces.
Economic Benefits
EV cars are much more economical than regular cars, and theyre much cheaper to run as well. EVs dont require gas, and theyre able to travel much farther on a single charge. This means that you have much less chance of running out of gas, and it also means that you have much less chance of being late to work or running out of gas on the road. EVs are also much more environmentally friendly, so you can expect to see a lot fewer of them on the road and see a lot less damage done to public roads with their tires.
Many People Are Already Driving Electric Cars
The most important reason to get an electric car in the UAE is that many people already own them. There are already more than 100,000 EVs on the road in the UAE, and this number is expected to increase significantly in the coming years. With this many people already driving EVs, its easy to see why it would make sense to get one too. Besides, the number of EVs is growing at a great rate, and this means that theyre likely to only become more popular in the next few years. If you want to be one of the people who get an EV when they become more popular, youd make a great choice.
Electric Vehicles Are Not Yet Popular In UAE
Though there are currently more than 100,000 EVs on the road in the UAE, theyre not yet very popular in the country. This is still very new technology, and most people are still unfamiliar with EVs. Theyre also much more expensive than regular cars, and this is another reason why theyre not very popular. If you want to get one, there are still a few things that you can do to make it happen. First, you need to contact your nearest Toyota dealership and ask them about EV sales. Second, you can visit the website of UAEs largest EV owners club to learn more about EV ownership in Dubai.

As soon as a car rolls off the assembly line, it starts emitting CO2 and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. To help reduce these harmful effects and make driving greener, more people are turning to electric cars as their personal automobiles of choice. Its not just because they dont emit harmful gases like CO2 from regular cars  there are a lot of other reasons why you should seriously consider purchasing one instead. Here are 6 reasons why you should consider buying an electric car.
Why Electric Car  Electricity Is Cheaper Than Gasoline
Electricity Is Cheaper Than Gasoline
Its no secret that gasoline is expensive. You can find prices listed on gas stations at every corner and you cant avoid reading about it in the news. The price of gas has been rising for many years now and its no wonder why people are turning to electric vehicles. They can be driven for miles on a single charge, so youll never have to worry about running out of gas. Additionally, many electric cars can be charged for free at charging stations installed in public places, such as parking lots, malls, or workplaces. Electricity is cheaper than gasoline because its free and comes from renewable sources. These are the exact reasons why you should drive an electric car. Gasoline is expensive, harmful to the environment, and poses a great risk to humans.
Electric Car- It is Safer
When it comes to safety, its hard to beat an electric car. As we mentioned above, they dont require the use of dangerous fossil fuels that fuel gasoline cars. Instead, they run on electricity generated by renewable resources, such as solar panels and wind turbines. With no combustion engine to combust harmful substances, the car is a lot safer. Its been estimated that one in three road accidents is caused by the dangerous emissions produced by conventional cars. If youre driving an electric car, theres a much lower risk that youll be involved in an accident. Another great advantage of electric cars is their quietness. Running on electricity instead of gasoline makes for a much smoother ride . Its also much quieter, so you wont be bothered by the noise of the car or the sound of the wind.
smoother ride
Electric Car  Better For The Environment
Better For The Environment
Electric cars are much better for the environment than gasoline cars. Since they dont require the use of fossil fuels, they contribute less to the CO2 emissions that cause global warming. Furthermore, many electric cars dont require regular maintenance, which is a big bonus as it saves you money. Moreover, they can be driven much longer distances on a single charge, which saves electricity and saves you money. Gasoline cars emit harmful substances such as CO2 that cause global warming and pose a serious threat to humans. Driving an electric car is a great way to make an impact on the environment. Electric cars are better for the environment because they dont emit dangerous CO2 and they dont require maintenance.
Electric Car  Theyre Quieter And Smoother Ride
Theyre Quieter And Smoother Ride
Since electric cars dont emit any harmful gases, theyre also much quieter than gasoline cars. This is another great advantage when it comes to safety  you wont have to worry about as much noise pollution. Another thing that makes driving an electric car smoother is its smoother ride. Most electric cars have computer-assisted traction control that allows them to drive smoothly on any surface. This means that you wont have to worry about maintaining your car or driving on an unpaved road. When it comes to driving an electric car, youll notice that theyre much smoother than gasoline cars. This is another advantage of driving an electric car.
Better Handling And Braking
Electric cars are also much better at handling and braking. Most electric cars have regenerative braking systems, which allow them to store energy. This means that you dont need to press the brake pedal all the way down like in a gasoline car. When you step on the gas pedal, the car brakes instead, using the energy it stored earlier. Its a great way to save fuel, reduce CO2 emissions, and make driving safer. Electric cars are also better at handling and braking because they dont have any metal parts that can get hot during the drive. This is yet another advantage of driving an electric car.
Conclusion
Overall, driving an electric car is a great decision for the environment, your wallet, and your safety. They dont require the use of harmful substances like fossil fuels, theyre much quieter and smoother than gasoline cars, and they dont require maintenance. They can be driven for longer distances on a single charge, they contribute fewer CO2 emissions, theyre safer, and theyre cleaner than gasoline cars.

Electric vehicle: How Much Does it Cost to Charge?
Anish Reddy
Electric Car
EV Maintenance
Owning an Electric Vehicle (EV) is an exciting step towards a greener world. Utility companies and private enterprises are rushing to provide charging stations and affordable electric cars to keep up with the growing demand. But how much does it cost to charge an Electric Vehicle?
To help you budget your monthly charging costs, weve broken down the figures so you know what to expect.
As the name implies, an electric vehicle (EV) is one that operates on electricity instead of fossil fuels like in a traditional car. The benefits of driving a car that runs solely on electricity are many.
The cost to charge an electric car can vary depending on several factors including where you live, whether you own your charging station, and how many miles your car gets per charge (e.g., city or highway). Many variables affect the final cost, but we can give you a ballpark estimate as well as insights into some ways you can reduce the cost of recharging your EV.
Lets take a look.
Most Electric Vehicle (EV) owners are concerned about the high initial costs and usually forget about the long-term savings that come from charging their car at home or the workplace.
Did you know: In typical circumstances, it costs 7x less to drive an EV for a month as compared to a traditional car
How much does it cost to charge an Electric Vehicle (EV) ?
How much does it cost to charge an Electric Vehicle
?
The best way to calculate this on your own is by dividing your electric bill by the total number of Kilowatts used per hour (kWh). Then take how many kWh your vehicle runs on and multiply that by how much you typically pay in electricity per hour.
Another way to consider how much you will likely pay to charge your EV is by breaking it down by the mathematical statement: The electricity cost per day is equal to the energy consumption, E, in kWh per day multiplied by the energy cost of 1 kWh in AED per kWh.
Cost(AED/day) = E(kWh/day)  Cost(AED/kWh)
Where do you live?
The cost to charge an Electric Vehicle (EV) at home is typically lower than at work, as the cost of electricity is much lower here. If you charge at home, you also have to factor in the cost of buying and installing a home charging unit.
While some EVs come with an onboard charger with a cable, most people prefer to have a dedicated home charger so that their car can charge at a much higher speed and is also much safer.
How many km will your Electric Vehicle get per charge?
The amount of electricity you use per km depends on the type of EV youre charging with. For example, if youre charging your EV with a Level 1 or Level 2 charging station (typically around 8 hours to 80%), the cost per kWh is around 0.38 AED.
If you want to charge your EV at a public charging station, youll have to pay a fixed fee per kWh set by the Utility provider (DEWA, FEWA, ADDC, AADC, etc.) for the electricity you use. Typically, this fee corresponds to around 6.7 AED/hr for AC chargers, depending on the station. If you charge at a DC Fast charger, the cost is usually around 46 AED/Hr at a 150kW unit.
How much electricity is available where you live to charge an Electric Vehicle?
The UAE Power Market is segmented by Power Generation (Natural Gas, Nuclear, and Renewables), and Transmission and Distribution. In areas that have warm summers and cold winters, renewable energy such as solar, wind, and geothermal power is getting cheaper and more accessible.
Electric Vehicle Chargers at Work and Home
Chargers at Work and Home
When you charge your EV at home, you can often choose from a few different types of charging stations depending on your homes wiring and available capacity. If you charge at work, most workplaces may have shared charging stations.
Bottom Line
How much charging your EV costs you have various factors. If you want to charge at home or work you can expect to pay 0.38 AED per kWh. If youd like to charge your EV at public charging stations, youll have to pay a fixed fee per kWh as per the tariff set by the Network. If you live in a premium property, the cost of charging can be higher as there will be a premium charged on the parking. As of today, the tariff is regulated by the utility providers in the country and we shall see how the policy moves over the coming months.

5 Factors That Affect Your EVs Charging Speed
Anish Reddy
Electric Car
EV Maintenance
If you power up your electric car, you might observe that you dont always receive the quickest charging rate that your automaker or the charger promised you. On different days, you also might find out that you are getting different charging speeds.
Why does it happen?
The answer is simple. Charging an electric vehicle is more similar to charging your phone than fuelling your vehicle at a gas station.
While every EV is different, here are five factors that affect charging speed:
The State of Charge (SoC) is an indicator of the amount of power left in your battery when you begin to charge it; its equivalent to a fuel gauge.
The State of Charge (SoC)
When your SoC is low, it is much easier for electrons to fill up the seats; in contrast, when your SoC is high, it takes longer for the electrons to find an available spot, thus slowing down the charging process.
Think of it as a movie theatre. When its empty, finding a seat is much simpler than when its full and you have to search for an opening and climb over peoples legs without spilling their popcorn. Similarly, the SoC of a battery affects the speed of the charging.
battery
The temperature of your EV affects recharging speed
The temperature of your EV
Generally, batteries need to be kept at a temperature that is neither too hot nor too cold. This is to protect the battery and maintain its health. An Electric Vehicle (EV) will have a Battery Management System (BMS) that is like the batterys brain, which monitors the batterys safety. Extreme temperatures can affect a batterys life expectancy.
Most EVs come with a thermal management system, which controls the temperature of the battery for it to stay at an optimum level. However, the outside weather can still influence the battery. If it is very hot or the battery has been charging for a long time and is heating up, the charging speed will be slower. Likewise, if it is freezing cold, the charging pace will also be slower.
Using your EV while recharging
If you stay in your car during fast charging, it is important to be aware that some of the energy that should be going to the battery is instead used up by cabin air conditioning, heating, lights, radio, and other accessories. Additionally, the thermal management system also utilizes some of the charging power to regulate the temperature of the battery. This is why it may seem like the kW display on the charger is a bit higher than what the in-dash displays show.
Battery deterioration
Over time, batteries can deteriorate and lose their charging capacity. As a rule of thumb, it is recommended to stop charging when the SoC reaches 80-85%. This not only prevents the battery from becoming too hot but also saves time as the charging rate decreases when the battery is close to being full.
Your vehicles current and voltage limits
Regardless of your EVs charging capacity, it has a max rate of charge it can take in. This maximum charge rate (also known as the voltage limit) is set for the vehicle. For example, if the EV has a maximum charging speed of 7 kW and the charger can give out 22 kW, the EV will still only draw energy at the rate of 7 kW. The opposite is also true, if the EV is able to take 15 kW but the charger can only provide 7 kW, the car will again only draw energy at 7 kW.
Overall, there are many factors that can affect your EV recharging speed, from the type of charger you are using to the temperature of the battery.

First-time Electric Vehicle (EV) Buyers Guide
Anish Reddy
Electric Car
Recently, you have probably seen an increase in the number of electric vehicles (EVs) on the road.
If you are ready to become a member of this growing group of EV owners, you may have some queries before making the purchase. What type of EV should I purchase? What should I consider when searching for an EV? Is there anything else I should be aware of? What are the costs associated with driving an EV?
Let us go through the steps to choose the best EV for you.
What kinds of EVs are available?
Right now, there are 3 main types of EVs that you can choose from on the market. They are:
1. Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs)
Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs)
Low-emission vehicles that use an electric motor to assist gas-powered engines. Energy comes from regenerative braking and gasoline.
2. Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs)
Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs)
Similar to a Hybrid, but with a larger battery and electric motor. Has a gas tank and a charging port. Can charge by using Level 2 chargers.
3. Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs)
Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs)
Powered solely by an electric battery, with no internal combustion engine. BEVs are the fastest growing of the three and are capable of fast charging and Level 2 charging. Zero emissions.
In choosing an EV, consider the vehicles type and choose the best suited for you.
Consider how you will use your EV
Before deciding to purchase an EV, you should think through the purpose it will serve. If you plan to only go to work or take short trips around your neighborhood, a vehicle with a smaller battery may be enough.
However, if you are going to drive long distances or make frequent trips, it would be beneficial to consider investing in an EV with a larger battery pack and range.
Assess the environmental friendliness of your EV
In terms of size and impact on the environment, each electric vehicle on the market is different.
The variety of electric vehicles available varies in size and respective environmental effects. If you aim to be eco-friendly, it is important to seek out a vehicle that will help you achieve that goal. You can use websites, such as the dubai ev hub , to help you find the EVs available for sale in UAE.
dubai ev hub
Compare costs of various EV models
Compare costs
To make sure you are able to save money, it is wise to look into any local incentives for getting an electric vehicle and figure out how much you may save annually. Compare that to the amount that you usually spend on your current vehicle  you may find that these incentives and the lower cost of driving EVs are sufficient to persuade you to change over!
Know how much time you have before every trip
Additionally, it could also be beneficial to analyze the cost of energy for either an all-electric vehicle or a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle. Occasionally, there are even complimentary public charging stations accessible that can reduce energy costs, which further encourages you to purchase an electric vehicle.
When you own an electric vehicle, you must be mindful of how much time you plan to spend on the road. You need to keep in mind the charging time for your EV. The duration of the charge is contingent on the type of EV charger that you use, as they all have different voltages. Choose DC Fast Chargers whenever you are in a hurry.
Three levels of EV charging stations are available, with different charging speeds, so it is important to consider your needs before buying a car.
Scope out potential EV charging points near you
You must map out all the available charging stations near you with an EV charging station finder like Regeny and take into account how many stations are around you. The Regeny App helps you find the most suitable EV chargers near you across the country.

BUSTED! 7 Electric Vehicle Myths Debunked
Anish Reddy
Electric Car
There are numerous myths about electric cars, and we are here to bust them. Read on to discover the reality of owning electric cars and some of the most talked about myths.
Myth #1 EVs have a limited range:
This is a common myth. But in reality, manufacturers have significantly improved electric vehicle batteries, reducing the possibility of drivers becoming stranded due to a lack of power. Modern EVs have a driving range that is more than enough to cover the daily needs of most drivers. According to research conducted using the Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure standard, the IONIQ5 can travel around 470-480 km on a single charge.
It is expected that the future of electric vehicle battery charging will be very promising. As there will be more and more charging stations popping up in different parts of the country.
Myth #2 EVs are very expensive:
It appears that the cost of electric vehicles (EVs) is likely to decline in the future. However, right now they are a bit more expensive than traditional gas-powered vehicles. On the other hand, EVs have several fiscal advantages and other discounts, and they require less maintenance, which makes them a great choice in the long run.
Myth #3 EV batteries cannot get recycled:
Automobiles with an internal combustion engine have lead-acid batteries which are highly reusable  up to around 90% in most countries. We should keep in mind that the current EV batteries are made with higher amounts of recyclable materials. These batteries are very durable, so much so that some of them can even outlast the life of the car itself.
car
Myth #4 EV batteries have a short life span:
Smartphone batteries tend to wear out after a couple of years as they need to be charged daily. On the other hand, the batteries for electric vehicles only require charging a few times each month. They are designed for smart charging, which means that the energy is distributed evenly throughout the many cells that make up the total battery pack.
Myth #5 Electric vehicles require costlier maintenance:
Despite their higher maintenance costs, electric vehicles have a lower running cost than traditional internal combustion engines (ICEs). This is because they do not necessitate frequent oil checks and oil changes, or any other kind of tuning. Furthermore, EVs have a more simplified structure with fewer parts that may need to be replaced.
Additionally, they work with one simple single-speed transmission and lack traditional components such as spark plugs, fuel tanks, valves, tailpipes, mufflers, starters, distributors, drive belts, clutches, catalytic converters, and hoses. These are the basic elements that construct the primary system of electric cars.
Myth #6 Not enough EV Chargers
Despite some skepticism about the practicality of owning an electric vehicle due to the availability of charging infrastructure, there are actually more charging points than people may realize.
In fact, in Dubai alone, there are currently 350 EV charging points. Additionally, it should be noted that most EV charging is done at home or at work on private charge points, making it easy and convenient for drivers. Therefore, many EV drivers rarely need to use public charging points and instead rely on charging their vehicles at home. For quick & hassle-free EV charger installation at home , talk to our experts today.

EV charging stations: A guide to monetize them
Anish Reddy
Electric Car
The global growth of electric vehicles has opened up a doorway of opportunity for entrepreneurs and establishments to establish their own EV charging stations. In this blog, we will discuss the various methods to monetize an EV charging station to make it a profitable & successful venture.
EV charging station
We will go over the techniques of how to monetise EV charging stations, as well as how to obtain customers and make use of the most modern technology to remain competitive.
As long as you take the right approach, you can make investing in an EV charging station a lucrative and successful business.
Market Analysis for EV Charging Stations
When figuring out the market for EV charging in your property, the initial move is to research the number of EVs and charging stations in the locale. This includes studying sales data, incentives, and existing infrastructure. Evaluating the prospective rise in the EV market is essential too as technology is continually advancing and the cost of ownership is going down.
After determining the present market, one must consider the kind of charging stations they would like to provide. One must take into account the costs, speed, and features to decide which one will best suit the local market. Finally, one should choose the most suitable pricing and financing options.
Lastly, companies need to plan their installation and maintenance of the charging stations. This involves access to skilled personnel, technology and the right tools.
Calculating the cost of EV charging stations
The pricing model for EV charging stations should consider key factors such as the cost of the charging station, the cost of electricity, and the potential income from customers. There are three main pricing models available, including pay-per-charge, subscription-based, and time-based, each of which has its pros and cons. Customize the chosen pricing model to the particular needs of the local market.
An EV Charging Station Loyalty Program
While designing a loyalty program, it is essential to think about what incentives would be most attractive to your customers. This could involve providing discounted rates on charging fees, exclusive discounts on accessories, or even distributing free products. We must also consider rewards that are convenient to redeem, such as digital coupons or points redeemable on the web.
Furthermore, it is essential to evaluate the success of your loyalty program. By monitoring the number of regular customers, you can gain insight into how successful your loyalty program is. Furthermore, customer feedback can help you comprehend how happy customers are with your loyalty program and how it can be improved.
Advertising EV Charging Stations
Advertising EV charging stations can be a great way for companies to make money and extend their reach. Advertisers may be able to identify a specific demographic, such as EV owners or people who are curious about electric vehicles and provide them with a dependable and convenient means to charge their cars.
Businesses may consider different types of advertisements, including digital ads, billboards, or even physical ads on the charging station itself. Businesses may also join forces with other companies to have their ads displayed on their charging station. Moreover, they may choose to create their own advertising initiatives. Or team up with local businesses to come up with a mutually beneficial campaign.
By taking advantage of promotional activities, businesses can create a reliable source of income while also offering a service to their patrons.
Public promotion of EV recharging stations
It is essential to make the public aware of EV charging station services to guarantee the long-term success of electric vehicle adoption. These services give electric vehicles a dependable supply of electricity. And help to reduce emissions and diminish reliance on fossil fuels. Advertising campaigns should be aimed at informing the public. It can be about the availability of EV refuelling services, emphasizing the advantages of using them, and furnishing incentives to convince people to switch to electric cars.
This could incorporate focused marketing, public education initiatives, and discounts or special offers on EV charging services. Also, it is vital to make sure that EV charging points are reachable, dependable, and reasonably priced.

6 Essential Tips for Hot Weather EV Driving
Anish Reddy
EV Maintenance
With the summer months upon us, electric vehicle (EV) owners may be wondering how to keep their cars running smoothly in the heat. Whether youre a seasoned EV owner or a newbie, its crucial to know how to maintain your vehicle properly during the summer months.
So, buckle up and get ready to learn how to keep your EV running like a dream this summer!
1. Use the ECO mode
Most modern electric vehicles have an eco mode. In addition to saving mileage, this feature reduces the energy used for other functions that consume charge behind the scenes such as air conditioner. The sophisticated feature also improves acceleration, dampens throttle response, and saves valuable battery power.
2. Only charge to 80% capacity
Only charge to 80% capacity
Industry experts say charging between 20% and 80% is the norm for keeping the battery in good shape, especially at high temperatures. Just like your cell phone, the battery gets hotter the longer you charge it. Combined with the sunny weather, this can lead to battery dissatisfaction (not to mention the increased risk of premature battery degradation).
3. Do not charge your EV immediately after driving
Do not charge your EV immediately after driving
Electric vehicle batteries are hot from previous rides, so it is not recommended to charge them too soon (especially if the charger has been exposed to direct sunlight). The best time to charge an EV is at night or early in the morning when temperatures are cooler. In addition, the charging fee is cheaper because it is not charged during the busy season!
4. Shadow is EVs best friend
Shadow is EVs best friend
The easiest and most obvious (and perhaps the most important tip!) is to avoid parking in direct sunlight. Park in a shaded area instead. Unless your electric car is left in the sun for long periods of time (and legally parked!), whether its under a tree, garage, or anywhere else, it helps protect the battery from overheating (and, the electric car does not consume much energy during cooling, so the cruising range can also be maximized!). Your car can get burned if it sits in the sun all day, Youll want to turn the A/C on full blast just to endure it. A sunshade windshield cover can also help.
5. Try EV Preconditioning
Try EV Preconditioning
Preconditioning is a popular feature for warming the interior of electric vehicles during cold weather. However, it also helps in summer. If your electric vehicle has a preconditioning function, you can remotely pre-cool the cabin before you get into the vehicle. This not only increases range by regulating electric vehicles to the optimum temperature to prevent overloading all day long but also makes for a more comfortable and sweat-free driving experience.
It also saves time by allowing you to pre-condition your EV before you travel. So you dont waste time blowing your air conditioner or fogging up your windows  a win-win solution! Tesla is one of the most used EVs with this feature. You can even set it up remotely via an app, so you dont have to leave your home!
6. Use fewer applications while driving
Have you ever noticed that when you open multiple applications on your phone, your device gets hot and slows down? EV batteries do the same. The more background processes your electric car runs, the hotter the battery gets.
When driving in hot weather, it is recommended to close some of these external applications if they are not important. Gaming apps, text messaging, and music streaming services running in electric vehicle software are just a few of the features that can be shut down to conserve vehicle battery life.
With these simple tips, you can make the most of your EV during the summer.

Renting vs. Buying an Electric Car
Anish Reddy
Electric Car
Renting vs buying an EV. Lets have a closer look. As the world continues to shift towards sustainable energy, electric vehicles have become an increasingly popular choice for environmentally conscious drivers.
However, with the high cost of purchasing an electric vehicle, many are left wondering whether its better to buy or rent. While buying offers the long-term benefits of ownership and potential savings, leasing provides a more affordable and flexible option with the ability to upgrade to newer models.
Its a dilemma that many are facing when it comes to electric vehicles, and the decision ultimately depends on individual circumstances and priorities.
In this blog, well explore the factors to consider when deciding whether to buy or rent an electric vehicle, so you can make an informed decision that suits your needs and budget.
Lets understand the difference between buying & renting an EV
Deciding between leasing or buying your next vehicle is a straightforward process.
If you prefer changing your car frequently and dont mind the limitations on mileage, leasing can be a great option. On the other hand, if you value the independence of owning a car, purchasing is the best choice.
Things to consider before making a decision- buying or renting an EV
Your Lifestyle
Before making a decision, ask yourself why are you specifically considering an EV. You need to keep in mind if youre going to travel short distances or long distances.
If youre just looking for a more sustainable option for a vehicle or just want to get a hang of the driving experience then renting is a more viable option for you. But if youre looking for a long-term noise-free driving experience, govt subsidies or simple before electricity is relatively cheaper than fuel then buying an EV is the way to go.
Your Finances
Before you come to a decision, check your financial situation and list which option is more viable for you in the longer run.
If you have enough savings to pay for a relatively large down payment, you can save a lot on your monthly payments and your future self will appreciate buying an electric car.
However, if you have a long-term savings plan but dont want to pay high upfront costs or high monthly payments, leasing may be the best option for you. Maintain your current lifestyle and savings while having access to a vehicle you can trust.
vehicle
Your Mindset
Buying an EV right now is a little expensive option but post-purchase benefits are numerous. Its more sustainable, no fuel is required so you save money on gas. It is environmentally friendly as they do not emit pollutants. The maintenance is low due to an efficient electric motor and of course, the performance is better. But all these options have long term commitment.
If youre an automobile enthusiast whod want to get the latest model of car with each passing year, renting is the best option for you.
In conclusion
Currently, purchasing an electric vehicle comes at a significant cost, which also results in a higher cost for car insurance. However, opting for short-term rental of an EV can be a viable option for those interested in testing it out for an extended period. Renting a car could also be a practical choice for those who anticipate minimal driving in their personal vehicle.

6 Benefits of Installing an EV Charger in your Community
Anish Reddy
Electric Car
EV charger for Residential Properties
As more and more people make the switch to electric vehicles, the demand for electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure continues to grow. While many public charging stations are available, having an EV charger in a residential community can offer several benefits to residents and property owners alike.
1. Convenience of charging
Convenience
One of the primary benefits of having an EV charger in a residential community is the convenience it provides to EV owners. With an EV charger at home, residents can charge their cars overnight or whenever its most convenient for them, without the need to search for public charging stations or wait in line. This can save time and hassle, especially for those with busy schedules or longer commutes.
2. Increased Property Value
Increased Property Value
There is more to apartment EV chargers than just meeting immediate demand. Your propertys value will increase as the number of EVs increases. This investment will further offset your upfront costs when youre ready to sell your property.
3. Cost Savings
Cost Savings
An EV charger in a residential area can help residents save money on fuel expenses as well.EVs are generally cheaper to operate than gas-powered cars, and with an EV charger at home, residents can take advantage of lower electricity rates to charge their cars. This can result in significant cost savings over time, especially for those who drive frequently or for longer distances.
4. Future-Proofing
Future-Proofing
Installing an EV charger in a residential community can help future-proof the property and keep it competitive in the real estate market. By offering EV charging as an amenity, property owners can attract and retain tenants who are looking for a more sustainable and cost-effective lifestyle.
5. Community Building
Community Building
Adding an EV charger in a residential area can create a sense of community and encourage eco-friendly habits among residents. By providing a convenient and accessible way to charge their EVs, residents can feel more connected to their community and more invested in sustainable living.
connected
6. Environmental Benefits of Installing EV Charger
Environmental Benefits
Another important benefit of having an EV charger in a residential community is the environmental impact. EVs produce significantly fewer emissions than gas-powered cars, so having EV chargers in a residential community can help reduce air pollution and improve local air quality. This can have a positive impact on public health, especially in densely populated urban areas.
In conclusion, as more and more people make the switch to electric vehicles, residential communities need to consider the benefits of installing EV chargers and making this amenity available to their residents.

Dont Get Stuck: Keep Up with Regular EV Charger Maintenance
Anish Reddy
EV Maintenance
Electric vehicles (EVs) are gaining popularity in the UAE as people seek eco-friendly and cost-effective transportation. However, owning an EV also means investing in an EV charger, and like any other electrical appliance, regular maintenance is essential to ensure it functions efficiently and safely. This blog will discuss the importance of regular maintenance for your EV charger in the UAE.
Heres What Regular Maintenance Involves
Some of the common maintenance tasks for an EV charger may include inspecting the unit for physical damage, checking electrical connections and wiring for signs of wear, and cleaning the charging ports to ensure they remain free from debris or corrosion.
Additionally, software updates may be necessary to ensure the charger is functioning with the latest security features and improvements. Its also important to have a qualified electrician periodically inspect the charger to ensure that it is correctly grounded and that all electrical connections are safe and secure.
Keeps the charger operating safely
Regular maintenance of your EV charger will ensure that it is functioning safely. Over time, wear and tear can cause the charger to become faulty, which could lead to electrical hazards, such as short circuits or electrical shocks. Regular maintenance can detect potential issues and prevent them from becoming major problems.
Increases the lifespan of the charger
Regular maintenance of the EV charger can help increase its lifespan. By keeping the charger clean and free of dust and debris, you can avoid overheating and other damage caused by a lack of maintenance. Proper cleaning and lubrication of the mechanical components can also help prevent wear and tear, extending the chargers life.
Reduces repair costs
Regular maintenance can help reduce the cost of repairs. Identifying and fixing issues early on can prevent small problems from becoming bigger and more expensive ones. In addition, regular maintenance can help avoid emergency repairs, which can be more costly than scheduled maintenance.
Improves efficiency
Regular maintenance can help improve the efficiency of your EV charger. If the charger is not operating efficiently, it could lead to longer charging times or even a decrease in charging capacity. By keeping the charger well-maintained, you can ensure that it is operating at optimal efficiency.
Maintains warranty
Regular maintenance is often required to maintain the warranty on the EV charger. Failing to follow the manufacturers recommended maintenance schedule could void the warranty. Therefore, it is important to keep records of all maintenance activities to prove that the charger has been well-maintained.
In conclusion, regular maintenance of your EV charger is essential to ensure its safety, efficiency, and longevity. With proper maintenance, you can avoid costly repairs, improve the lifespan of the charger, and keep it operating efficiently.

EV boom in the UAE- 2023 Looks a Whole lot Greener
Anish Reddy
Electric Car
2023 will be pivotal for the automotive industry due to the impending EV boom. Governments worldwide demand sustainable transportation due to high climate change concerns, including the UAE. In this blog, well take a closer look at why 2023 is set to be the year of the EV boom and what this means for the UAE.
One of the key factors driving the growth of EVs is the falling cost of batteries. With advancements in battery technology, the cost of producing EVs has come down significantly over the past few years. As a result, EVs are becoming more affordable for consumers, and were seeing a surge in demand for these vehicles. In fact, many experts predict that by 2023, the cost of owning an EV will be on par with that of a traditional gasoline-powered vehicle.
Another factor driving the EV boom is government policies and incentives. The UAE government is to install 3,000+ public charging stations by 2023 with significant investments in EV charging infrastructure. Additionally, the government has introduced a range of incentives to encourage consumers to switch to EVs, including tax breaks and free parking.
The rise of ride-hailing services is also playing a role in the EV boom. Companies like Uber and Careem have pledged to make their fleets fully electric by 2030, which is driving demand for EVs in the commercial sector. This, in turn, is putting pressure on automakers to increase production of EVs to meet demand.
So, what does all of this mean for the UAE?
Well, for starters, it means that the country is well-positioned to become a leader in the global EV market. The UAE charges ahead to an electrified future with ambitious EV infra and incentives, nurturing a sustainable ecosystem. This, in turn, is attracting investors and startups to the region, which could lead to the creation of new jobs and economic growth.
Furthermore, the EV boom is good news for the environment. EVs can significantly cut UAEs carbon footprint and support sustainability goals via emissions reduction.
boom
In conclusion
2023 is shaping up to be a pivotal year for the EV industry. With falling battery costs, government policies, and the rise of ride-hailing services all driving demand for these vehicles, the stage is set for a surge in EV sales. For the UAE, this presents an opportunity to become a leader in the global EV market and make significant progress toward its sustainability goals.

EV Charging Stations 101: Which Type Is Right for You?
Anish Reddy
EV Charging Station
Electric vehicles (EVs) have been gaining popularity in recent years as people become more environmentally conscious. As a result, there has been an increase in the number of charging stations across the country. However, with so many options available, it can be challenging to know which type of EV charging station is right for you. In this blog, we will explore the different types of EV charging stations and help you determine which one suits your needs.
Level 1 EV Charging Station
Lets start with the basics: Level 1 charging stations. These chargers are the most straightforward and cost-effective option available. They typically use a standard 120-volt outlet, which can be found in most homes and garages. Level 1 charging stations offer a charging rate of around 4 to 5 miles of range per hour, making them perfect for people who dont drive much or have a lot of time to charge.
AC EV Charging Stations
AC charging stations, also known as Level 2 chargers, are the most common type of charging station youll find. They use an AC power source to charge your EVs battery, and they can be found in both residential and commercial locations. AC chargers are perfect for daily charging needs, as they provide a charging rate of around 25-30 miles per hour. They are also relatively affordable and easy to install, making them an excellent option for most EV owners.
DC EV Charging Stations
DC charging stations, also known as Level 3 or fast chargers, are the most potent and fastest charging option available. They use a direct current (DC) power source to charge your EVs battery and can deliver a whopping 80% charge in as little as 20-30 minutes! However, DC charging stations are much more expensive than AC chargers and require a specialized installation. DC charging stations are ideal for those who need a quick charge on the go, such as long-distance travelers.
Which One is Right for You?
Determining which type of charger is right for you depends on your individual needs. If you have a daily commute or use your EV for short trips around town, an AC charging station is likely sufficient. However, if you frequently travel long distances, a DC charging station may be necessary to keep up with your charging
In conclusion
Choosing the right EV charging station can seem overwhelming, but with a little research and consideration, you can find the perfect charging solution for your needs. Remember to take into account your driving habits, the amount of time you have to charge, and your budget before making a decision. Whatever your choice, youll be doing your part to help the environment and reduce your carbon footprint.

Introduction
As the world continues to grapple with the consequences of climate change, the need for sustainable transportation solutions becomes increasingly pressing. In the United Arab Emirates (UAE), a major player in the global transportation industry, the rise of Electric Vehicles (EVs) and the widespread establishment of EV charging stations have set in motion a revolutionary transformation in the way we think about transportation. This blog explores the significant impact of EV recharging stations in the UAE and how they are reshaping the future of mobility.

EV charging stations play a crucial role in this effort by providing the necessary infrastructure to support the adoption of electric vehicles. These stations are strategically located across the country, making EV recharging convenient and accessible to both residents and tourists alike.
Accelerating the Adoption of Electric Vehicles
One of the main barriers to widespread EV adoption is range anxiety  the fear of running out of battery power while on the road. The presence of a well-established network of EV charging stations mitigates this concern by assuring drivers that they can easily recharge their vehicles during their journeys. This reassurance encourages more people to make the switch to electric vehicles, leading to a substantial reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution.
Enhancing the Convenience of EV Ownership
EV charging stations are designed to provide a seamless charging experience for EV owners. They offer different types of charging options, including standard and fast charging, catering to the diverse needs of electric vehicle users. Additionally, many charging stations are equipped with advanced technologies that enable drivers to monitor charging progress, pay for services, and access real-time information through user-friendly smartphone applications. This convenience factor further incentivises individuals to embrace electric vehicles as their primary mode of transportation.
Economic Opportunities and Job Creation
The rapid expansion of EV charging infrastructure in the UAE has led to the creation of new economic opportunities. The installation , operation, and maintenance of EV recharging stations have generated jobs in various sectors, including construction, technology, and service industries. Additionally, the growth of the EV charging ecosystem has opened avenues for entrepreneurship and innovation, attracting local and international businesses to invest in this emerging market.

This initiative marks a significant milestone in the regions automotive landscape, aligning with global sustainability goals and the growing consumer demand for electric vehicles (EVs).
At Regeny , we view Hyundais commitment as a catalyst for change, mirroring our own vision of making electric mobility accessible and seamless for everyone.
Overview of Hyundais IONIQ Range
Hyundais foray into the EV market with the Hyundais IONIQ 5 and IONIQ 6 exemplifies innovation and futuristic design. The IONIQ 5, known for its unique angular design and state-of-the-art technology, offers impressive range and fast charging capabilities, setting a new benchmark for electric SUVs.
Meanwhile, the IONIQ 6 follows suit with its sleek, aerodynamic profile and efficiency, pushing the boundaries of what electric sedans can achieve.

Impact on the Middle Easts Mobility
Hyundais IONIQ range launch is not merely an introduction of new vehicles; it represents a significant leap towards sustainable mobility in the Middle East. This region, known for its rich oil reserves and traditionally high dependency on fossil fuels, is witnessing a paradigm shift.
Governments across the Middle East are increasingly investing in green infrastructure, including EV charging stations, to reduce carbon emissions and combat climate change. The IONIQ 5 and IONIQ 6 are poised to meet this growing demand for EVs, offering an attractive combination of performance, reliability, and eco-friendliness that appeals to the environmentally conscious consumer.
Moreover, the introduction of such advanced EVs stimulates the automotive market, encouraging competition and innovation. This is crucial for accelerating the adoption of electric vehicles, as it ensures a broader range of options for consumers and helps dispel common concerns about EV performance and charging infrastructure availability. Hyundais commitment to electric mobility in the Middle East is thus a pivotal moment, signaling a future where electric vehicles are the norm rather than the exception.

Regenys smart platform and mobile app play a critical role in this ecosystem, offering users real-time information on charging station availability, charging status, and payment options.
This level of convenience and efficiency is vital for supporting the growing community of EV users in the Middle East, ensuring that the transition to electric mobility is smooth and hassle-free.

At Regeny, our vision extends beyond providing state-of-the-art charging solutions. We aim to build a comprehensive community of EV users, manufacturers, and stakeholders, all united in the mission to promote sustainable electric mobility.
Hyundais launch of the IONIQ range in the Middle East contributes significantly to this vision, by increasing the visibility of EVs and encouraging more consumers to consider electric options.
Conclusion
Hyundais introduction of the IONIQ 5 and IONIQ 6 in the Middle East is more than just a milestone for the automotive industry; it is a testament to the regions evolving relationship with sustainable practices and technologies.

Regenys Electric Vehicle Chargers are Empowering Smart Cities
Welcome to a cleaner, greener future! As the world races towards sustainable energy solutions, electric vehicles (EVs) have emerged as a powerful catalyst for positive change.
The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is embracing this transformative technology, and at Regeny, we are proud to be at the forefront of the EV charger manufacturing and installation movement.
Today, we delve into the heart of why installing EV chargers is not only essential for the growth of smart cities and governments.
But also a significant step towards environmental preservation and energy efficiency.

2. Electric Fuelling Sustainable Urban Mobility:
Smart governments understand that sustainable urban mobility is the key to a prosperous future. Encouraging the adoption of electric vehicles goes beyond merely offering green alternatives; it lays the groundwork for a cleaner, healthier, and more efficient urban landscape.
When governments prioritize the installation of EV chargers, they demonstrate a commitment to combatting air pollution, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and fostering a more sustainable environment for generations to come.
3. Stimulating Economic Growth:
Beyond its environmental benefits, embracing EV charger installation stimulates economic growth in multiple ways. The burgeoning electric vehicle market opens up new job opportunities, driving innovation in manufacturing, technology, and infrastructure development.
Smart cities investing in EV chargers attract forward-thinking businesses and individuals, leading to increased real estate value, tourism, and local spending.
Its a win-win situation that fosters a thriving economy while supporting a cleaner, healthier planet.
4. Empowering Individuals with Energy Independence:
Imagine never worrying about fluctuating fuel prices or being tied to the limitations of traditional gas stations. EV charger installation empowers individuals with energy independence, granting them the freedom to charge their vehicles at their convenience, be it at home, work, or public charging stations.
The ability to charge an electric vehicle at home not only simplifies daily life but also encourages more people to adopt EVs, knowing that they have a reliable and accessible charging solution wherever they go.
5. Leading by an Electric Example:
Governments play a vital role in leading by example. By integrating electric vehicles into their official fleets and encouraging public sector organizations to adopt EVs, they send a powerful message of commitment to sustainability and environmental stewardship.
When citizens witness their leaders actively supporting EV adoption, it inspires confidence and trust in the transition to a clean energy future.

Electric vehicle: How Much Does it Cost to Charge?
Owning an Electric Vehicle (EV) is an exciting step towards a greener world. Utility companies and private enterprises are rushing to provide charging stations and affordable electric cars to keep up with the growing demand. But how much does it cost to charge an Electric Vehicle?
To help you budget your monthly charging costs, weve broken down the figures so you know what to expect.
As the name implies, an electric vehicle (EV) is one that operates on electricity instead of fossil fuels like in a traditional car. The benefits of driving a car that runs solely on electricity are many.
The cost to charge an electric car can vary depending on several factors including where you live, whether you own your charging station, and how many miles your car gets per charge (e.g., city or highway). Many variables affect the final cost, but we can give you a ballpark estimate as well as insights into some ways you can reduce the cost of recharging your EV.
Lets take a look.
Most Electric Vehicle (EV) owners are concerned about the high initial costs and usually forget about the long-term savings that come from charging their car at home or the workplace.
Did you know: In typical circumstances, it costs 7x less to drive an EV for a month as compared to a traditional car
How much does it cost to charge an Electric Vehicle (EV) ?
How much does it cost to charge an Electric Vehicle
?
The best way to calculate this on your own is by dividing your electric bill by the total number of Kilowatts used per hour (kWh). Then take how many kWh your vehicle runs on and multiply that by how much you typically pay in electricity per hour.
Another way to consider how much you will likely pay to charge your EV is by breaking it down by the mathematical statement: The electricity cost per day is equal to the energy consumption, E, in kWh per day multiplied by the energy cost of 1 kWh in AED per kWh.
Cost(AED/day) = E(kWh/day)  Cost(AED/kWh)
Where do you live?
The cost to charge an Electric Vehicle (EV) at home is typically lower than at work, as the cost of electricity is much lower here. If you charge at home, you also have to factor in the cost of buying and installing a home charging unit.
While some EVs come with an onboard charger with a cable, most people prefer to have a dedicated home charger so that their car can charge at a much higher speed and is also much safer.
How many km will your Electric Vehicle get per charge?
The amount of electricity you use per km depends on the type of EV youre charging with. For example, if youre charging your EV with a Level 1 or Level 2 charging station (typically around 8 hours to 80%), the cost per kWh is around 0.38 AED.
If you want to charge your EV at a public charging station, youll have to pay a fixed fee per kWh set by the Utility provider (DEWA, FEWA, ADDC, AADC, etc.) for the electricity you use. Typically, this fee corresponds to around 6.7 AED/hr for AC chargers, depending on the station. If you charge at a DC Fast charger, the cost is usually around 46 AED/Hr at a 150kW unit.
How much electricity is available where you live to charge an Electric Vehicle?
The UAE Power Market is segmented by Power Generation (Natural Gas, Nuclear, and Renewables), and Transmission and Distribution. In areas that have warm summers and cold winters, renewable energy such as solar, wind, and geothermal power is getting cheaper and more accessible.
Electric Vehicle Chargers at Work and Home
Chargers at Work and Home
When you charge your EV at home, you can often choose from a few different types of charging stations depending on your homes wiring and available capacity. If you charge at work, most workplaces may have shared charging stations.
Bottom Line
How much charging your EV costs you have various factors. If you want to charge at home or work you can expect to pay 0.38 AED per kWh. If youd like to charge your EV at public charging stations, youll have to pay a fixed fee per kWh as per the tariff set by the Network. If you live in a premium property, the cost of charging can be higher as there will be a premium charged on the parking. As of today, the tariff is regulated by the utility providers in the country and we shall see how the policy moves over the coming months.

If youre interested in finding out how much it costs to charge your EV, its best to talk to our industry experts.

Renting vs. Buying an Electric Car
Renting vs buying an EV. Lets have a closer look. As the world continues to shift towards sustainable energy, electric vehicles have become an increasingly popular choice for environmentally conscious drivers.
However, with the high cost of purchasing an electric vehicle, many are left wondering whether its better to buy or rent. While buying offers the long-term benefits of ownership and potential savings, leasing provides a more affordable and flexible option with the ability to upgrade to newer models.
Its a dilemma that many are facing when it comes to electric vehicles, and the decision ultimately depends on individual circumstances and priorities.
In this blog, well explore the factors to consider when deciding whether to buy or rent an electric vehicle, so you can make an informed decision that suits your needs and budget.
Lets understand the difference between buying & renting an EV
Deciding between leasing or buying your next vehicle is a straightforward process.
If you prefer changing your car frequently and dont mind the limitations on mileage, leasing can be a great option. On the other hand, if you value the independence of owning a car, purchasing is the best choice.
Things to consider before making a decision- buying or renting an EV
Your Lifestyle
Before making a decision, ask yourself why are you specifically considering an EV. You need to keep in mind if youre going to travel short distances or long distances.
If youre just looking for a more sustainable option for a vehicle or just want to get a hang of the driving experience then renting is a more viable option for you. But if youre looking for a long-term noise-free driving experience, govt subsidies or simple before electricity is relatively cheaper than fuel then buying an EV is the way to go.
Your Finances
Before you come to a decision, check your financial situation and list which option is more viable for you in the longer run.
If you have enough savings to pay for a relatively large down payment, you can save a lot on your monthly payments and your future self will appreciate buying an electric car.
However, if you have a long-term savings plan but dont want to pay high upfront costs or high monthly payments, leasing may be the best option for you. Maintain your current lifestyle and savings while having access to a vehicle you can trust.
vehicle
Your Mindset
Buying an EV right now is a little expensive option but post-purchase benefits are numerous. Its more sustainable, no fuel is required so you save money on gas. It is environmentally friendly as they do not emit pollutants. The maintenance is low due to an efficient electric motor and of course, the performance is better. But all these options have long term commitment.
If youre an automobile enthusiast whod want to get the latest model of car with each passing year, renting is the best option for you.
In conclusion
Currently, purchasing an electric vehicle comes at a significant cost, which also results in a higher cost for car insurance. However, opting for short-term rental of an EV can be a viable option for those interested in testing it out for an extended period. Renting a car could also be a practical choice for those who anticipate minimal driving in their personal vehicle.

BUSTED! 7 Electric Vehicle Myths Debunked
There are numerous myths about electric cars, and we are here to bust them. Read on to discover the reality of owning electric cars and some of the most talked about myths.
Myth #1 EVs have a limited range:
This is a common myth. But in reality, manufacturers have significantly improved electric vehicle batteries, reducing the possibility of drivers becoming stranded due to a lack of power. Modern EVs have a driving range that is more than enough to cover the daily needs of most drivers. According to research conducted using the Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure standard, the IONIQ5 can travel around 470-480 km on a single charge.
It is expected that the future of electric vehicle battery charging will be very promising. As there will be more and more charging stations popping up in different parts of the country.
Myth #2 EVs are very expensive:
It appears that the cost of electric vehicles (EVs) is likely to decline in the future. However, right now they are a bit more expensive than traditional gas-powered vehicles. On the other hand, EVs have several fiscal advantages and other discounts, and they require less maintenance, which makes them a great choice in the long run.
Myth #3 EV batteries cannot get recycled:
Automobiles with an internal combustion engine have lead-acid batteries which are highly reusable  up to around 90% in most countries. We should keep in mind that the current EV batteries are made with higher amounts of recyclable materials. These batteries are very durable, so much so that some of them can even outlast the life of the car itself.
car
Myth #4 EV batteries have a short life span:
Smartphone batteries tend to wear out after a couple of years as they need to be charged daily. On the other hand, the batteries for electric vehicles only require charging a few times each month. They are designed for smart charging, which means that the energy is distributed evenly throughout the many cells that make up the total battery pack.
Myth #5 Electric vehicles require costlier maintenance:
Despite their higher maintenance costs, electric vehicles have a lower running cost than traditional internal combustion engines (ICEs). This is because they do not necessitate frequent oil checks and oil changes, or any other kind of tuning. Furthermore, EVs have a more simplified structure with fewer parts that may need to be replaced.
Additionally, they work with one simple single-speed transmission and lack traditional components such as spark plugs, fuel tanks, valves, tailpipes, mufflers, starters, distributors, drive belts, clutches, catalytic converters, and hoses. These are the basic elements that construct the primary system of electric cars.
Myth #6 Not enough EV Chargers
Despite some skepticism about the practicality of owning an electric vehicle due to the availability of charging infrastructure, there are actually more charging points than people may realize.
In fact, in Dubai alone, there are currently 350 EV charging points. Additionally, it should be noted that most EV charging is done at home or at work on private charge points, making it easy and convenient for drivers. Therefore, many EV drivers rarely need to use public charging points and instead rely on charging their vehicles at home. For quick & hassle-free EV charger installation at home , talk to our experts today.

Myth #7 EVs are too slow to charge:
Contrary to the opinion that electric vehicles (EVs) are slow to charge, they are actually quicker by the day. With DC Ultrafast Chargers and battery technology getting better, slow charging will soon be a thing of the past. You can still choose a home charger to plug in your car and let it charge while you sleep.
In conclusion, it is clear that using electric vehicles is much simpler than one may think. They are secure, dependable, and effortless to manage and maintain, all while being environmentally friendly. Dont forget to check out How to pick the right Electric Vehicle for yourself in UAE .
How to pick the right Electric Vehicle for yourself in UAE
Recently, you have probably seen an increase in the number of electric vehicles (EVs) on the road.
If you are ready to become a member of this growing group of EV owners, you may have some queries before making the purchase. What type of EV should I purchase? What should I consider when searching for an EV? Is there anything else I should be aware of? What are the costs associated with driving an EV?
Let us go through the steps to choose the best EV for you.
What kinds of EVs are available?
Right now, there are 3 main types of EVs that you can choose from on the market. They are:
1. Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs)
Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs)
Low-emission vehicles that use an electric motor to assist gas-powered engines. Energy comes from regenerative braking and gasoline.
2. Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs)
Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs)
Similar to a Hybrid, but with a larger battery and electric motor. Has a gas tank and a charging port. Can charge by using Level 2 chargers.
3. Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs)
Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs)
Powered solely by an electric battery, with no internal combustion engine. BEVs are the fastest growing of the three and are capable of fast charging and Level 2 charging. Zero emissions.
In choosing an EV, consider the vehicles type and choose the best suited for you.
Consider how you will use your EV
Before deciding to purchase an EV, you should think through the purpose it will serve. If you plan to only go to work or take short trips around your neighborhood, a vehicle with a smaller battery may be enough.
However, if you are going to drive long distances or make frequent trips, it would be beneficial to consider investing in an EV with a larger battery pack and range.
Assess the environmental friendliness of your EV
In terms of size and impact on the environment, each electric vehicle on the market is different.
The variety of electric vehicles available varies in size and respective environmental effects. If you aim to be eco-friendly, it is important to seek out a vehicle that will help you achieve that goal. You can use websites, such as the dubai ev hub , to help you find the EVs available for sale in UAE.
dubai ev hub
Compare costs of various EV models
Compare costs
To make sure you are able to save money, it is wise to look into any local incentives for getting an electric vehicle and figure out how much you may save annually. Compare that to the amount that you usually spend on your current vehicle  you may find that these incentives and the lower cost of driving EVs are sufficient to persuade you to change over!
Know how much time you have before every trip
Additionally, it could also be beneficial to analyze the cost of energy for either an all-electric vehicle or a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle. Occasionally, there are even complimentary public charging stations accessible that can reduce energy costs, which further encourages you to purchase an electric vehicle.
When you own an electric vehicle, you must be mindful of how much time you plan to spend on the road. You need to keep in mind the charging time for your EV. The duration of the charge is contingent on the type of EV charger that you use, as they all have different voltages. Choose DC Fast Chargers whenever you are in a hurry.
Three levels of EV charging stations are available, with different charging speeds, so it is important to consider your needs before buying a car.
Scope out potential EV charging points near you
You must map out all the available charging stations near you with an EV charging station finder like Regeny and take into account how many stations are around you. The Regeny App helps you find the most suitable EV chargers near you across the country.
We specialize in EV charging solutions with a complete range of AC & DC fast chargers .

Electric vehicle: How Much Does it Cost to Charge?
Owning an Electric Vehicle (EV) is an exciting step towards a greener world. Utility companies and private enterprises are rushing to provide charging stations and affordable electric cars to keep up with the growing demand. But how much does it cost to charge an Electric Vehicle?
To help you budget your monthly charging costs, weve broken down the figures so you know what to expect.
As the name implies, an electric vehicle (EV) is one that operates on electricity instead of fossil fuels like in a traditional car. The benefits of driving a car that runs solely on electricity are many.
The cost to charge an electric car can vary depending on several factors including where you live, whether you own your charging station, and how many miles your car gets per charge (e.g., city or highway). Many variables affect the final cost, but we can give you a ballpark estimate as well as insights into some ways you can reduce the cost of recharging your EV.
Lets take a look.
Most Electric Vehicle (EV) owners are concerned about the high initial costs and usually forget about the long-term savings that come from charging their car at home or the workplace.
Did you know: In typical circumstances, it costs 7x less to drive an EV for a month as compared to a traditional car
How much does it cost to charge an Electric Vehicle (EV) ?
How much does it cost to charge an Electric Vehicle
?
The best way to calculate this on your own is by dividing your electric bill by the total number of Kilowatts used per hour (kWh). Then take how many kWh your vehicle runs on and multiply that by how much you typically pay in electricity per hour.
Another way to consider how much you will likely pay to charge your EV is by breaking it down by the mathematical statement: The electricity cost per day is equal to the energy consumption, E, in kWh per day multiplied by the energy cost of 1 kWh in AED per kWh.
Cost(AED/day) = E(kWh/day)  Cost(AED/kWh)
Where do you live?
The cost to charge an Electric Vehicle (EV) at home is typically lower than at work, as the cost of electricity is much lower here. If you charge at home, you also have to factor in the cost of buying and installing a home charging unit.
While some EVs come with an onboard charger with a cable, most people prefer to have a dedicated home charger so that their car can charge at a much higher speed and is also much safer.
How many km will your Electric Vehicle get per charge?
The amount of electricity you use per km depends on the type of EV youre charging with. For example, if youre charging your EV with a Level 1 or Level 2 charging station (typically around 8 hours to 80%), the cost per kWh is around 0.38 AED.
If you want to charge your EV at a public charging station, youll have to pay a fixed fee per kWh set by the Utility provider (DEWA, FEWA, ADDC, AADC, etc.) for the electricity you use. Typically, this fee corresponds to around 6.7 AED/hr for AC chargers, depending on the station. If you charge at a DC Fast charger, the cost is usually around 46 AED/Hr at a 150kW unit.
How much electricity is available where you live to charge an Electric Vehicle?
The UAE Power Market is segmented by Power Generation (Natural Gas, Nuclear, and Renewables), and Transmission and Distribution. In areas that have warm summers and cold winters, renewable energy such as solar, wind, and geothermal power is getting cheaper and more accessible.
Electric Vehicle Chargers at Work and Home
Chargers at Work and Home
When you charge your EV at home, you can often choose from a few different types of charging stations depending on your homes wiring and available capacity. If you charge at work, most workplaces may have shared charging stations.
Bottom Line
How much charging your EV costs you have various factors. If you want to charge at home or work you can expect to pay 0.38 AED per kWh. If youd like to charge your EV at public charging stations, youll have to pay a fixed fee per kWh as per the tariff set by the Network. If you live in a premium property, the cost of charging can be higher as there will be a premium charged on the parking. As of today, the tariff is regulated by the utility providers in the country and we shall see how the policy moves over the coming months.

6 Benefits of Installing an EV Charger in your Community

This can save time and hassle, especially for those with busy schedules or longer commutes.
2. Increased Property Value
Increased Property Value
There is more to apartment EV chargers than just meeting immediate demand. Your propertys value will increase as the number of EVs increases. This investment will further offset your upfront costs when youre ready to sell your property.
3. Cost Savings
Cost Savings
An EV charger in a residential area can help residents save money on fuel expenses as well.EVs are generally cheaper to operate than gas-powered cars, and with an EV charger at home, residents can take advantage of lower electricity rates to charge their cars. This can result in significant cost savings over time, especially for those who drive frequently or for longer distances.
4. Future-Proofing

While many public charging stations are available, having an EV charger in a residential community can offer several benefits to residents and property owners alike.
1. Convenience of charging
Convenience
One of the primary benefits of having an EV charger in a residential community is the convenience it provides to EV owners. With an EV charger at home, residents can charge their cars overnight or whenever its most convenient for them, without the need to search for public charging stations or wait in line. This can save time and hassle, especially for those with busy schedules or longer commutes.
2. Increased Property Value
Increased Property Value
There is more to apartment EV chargers than just meeting immediate demand. Your propertys value will increase as the number of EVs increases. This investment will further offset your upfront costs when youre ready to sell your property.
3. Cost Savings
Cost Savings
An EV charger in a residential area can help residents save money on fuel expenses as well.EVs are generally cheaper to operate than gas-powered cars, and with an EV charger at home, residents can take advantage of lower electricity rates to charge their cars. This can result in significant cost savings over time, especially for those who drive frequently or for longer distances.
4. Future-Proofing
Future-Proofing
Installing an EV charger in a residential community can help future-proof the property and keep it competitive in the real estate market. By offering EV charging as an amenity, property owners can attract and retain tenants who are looking for a more sustainable and cost-effective lifestyle.
5. Community Building
Community Building
Adding an EV charger in a residential area can create a sense of community and encourage eco-friendly habits among residents. By providing a convenient and accessible way to charge their EVs, residents can feel more connected to their community and more invested in sustainable living.

6. Environmental Benefits of Installing EV Charger
Environmental Benefits
Another important benefit of having an EV charger in a residential community is the environmental impact. EVs produce significantly fewer emissions than gas-powered cars, so having EV chargers in a residential community can help reduce air pollution and improve local air quality. This can have a positive impact on public health, especially in densely populated urban areas.
In conclusion, as more and more people make the switch to electric vehicles, residential communities need to consider the benefits of installing EV chargers and making this amenity available to their residents.

6 Essential Tips for Hot Weather EV Driving
With the summer months upon us, electric vehicle (EV) owners may be wondering how to keep their cars running smoothly in the heat. Whether youre a seasoned EV owner or a newbie, its crucial to know how to maintain your vehicle properly during the summer months.
So, buckle up and get ready to learn how to keep your EV running like a dream this summer!
1. Use the ECO mode
Most modern electric vehicles have an eco mode. In addition to saving mileage, this feature reduces the energy used for other functions that consume charge behind the scenes such as air conditioner. The sophisticated feature also improves acceleration, dampens throttle response, and saves valuable battery power.
2. Only charge to 80% capacity
Only charge to 80% capacity
Industry experts say charging between 20% and 80% is the norm for keeping the battery in good shape, especially at high temperatures. Just like your cell phone, the battery gets hotter the longer you charge it. Combined with the sunny weather, this can lead to battery dissatisfaction (not to mention the increased risk of premature battery degradation).
3. Do not charge your EV immediately after driving
Do not charge your EV immediately after driving
Electric vehicle batteries are hot from previous rides, so it is not recommended to charge them too soon (especially if the charger has been exposed to direct sunlight). The best time to charge an EV is at night or early in the morning when temperatures are cooler. In addition, the charging fee is cheaper because it is not charged during the busy season!
4. Shadow is EVs best friend
Shadow is EVs best friend
The easiest and most obvious (and perhaps the most important tip!) is to avoid parking in direct sunlight. Park in a shaded area instead. Unless your electric car is left in the sun for long periods of time (and legally parked!), whether its under a tree, garage, or anywhere else, it helps protect the battery from overheating (and, the electric car does not consume much energy during cooling, so the cruising range can also be maximized!). Your car can get burned if it sits in the sun all day, Youll want to turn the A/C on full blast just to endure it. A sunshade windshield cover can also help.
5. Try EV Preconditioning
Try EV Preconditioning
Preconditioning is a popular feature for warming the interior of electric vehicles during cold weather. However, it also helps in summer. If your electric vehicle has a preconditioning function, you can remotely pre-cool the cabin before you get into the vehicle. This not only increases range by regulating electric vehicles to the optimum temperature to prevent overloading all day long but also makes for a more comfortable and sweat-free driving experience.
It also saves time by allowing you to pre-condition your EV before you travel. So you dont waste time blowing your air conditioner or fogging up your windows  a win-win solution! Tesla is one of the most used EVs with this feature. You can even set it up remotely via an app, so you dont have to leave your home!
6. Use fewer applications while driving
Have you ever noticed that when you open multiple applications on your phone, your device gets hot and slows down? EV batteries do the same. The more background processes your electric car runs, the hotter the battery gets.
When driving in hot weather, it is recommended to close some of these external applications if they are not important. Gaming apps, text messaging, and music streaming services running in electric vehicle software are just a few of the features that can be shut down to conserve vehicle battery life.
With these simple tips, you can make the most of your EV during the summer.

EV charging station
We will go over the techniques of how to monetise EV charging stations, as well as how to obtain customers and make use of the most modern technology to remain competitive.
As long as you take the right approach, you can make investing in an EV charging station a lucrative and successful business.
Market Analysis for EV Charging Stations
When figuring out the market for EV charging in your property, the initial move is to research the number of EVs and charging stations in the locale. This includes studying sales data, incentives, and existing infrastructure. Evaluating the prospective rise in the EV market is essential too as technology is continually advancing and the cost of ownership is going down.
After determining the present market, one must consider the kind of charging stations they would like to provide. One must take into account the costs, speed, and features to decide which one will best suit the local market. Finally, one should choose the most suitable pricing and financing options.
Lastly, companies need to plan their installation and maintenance of the charging stations. This involves access to skilled personnel, technology and the right tools.
Calculating the cost of EV charging stations
The pricing model for EV charging stations should consider key factors such as the cost of the charging station, the cost of electricity, and the potential income from customers. There are three main pricing models available, including pay-per-charge, subscription-based, and time-based, each of which has its pros and cons. Customize the chosen pricing model to the particular needs of the local market.
An EV Charging Station Loyalty Program
While designing a loyalty program, it is essential to think about what incentives would be most attractive to your customers. This could involve providing discounted rates on charging fees, exclusive discounts on accessories, or even distributing free products. We must also consider rewards that are convenient to redeem, such as digital coupons or points redeemable on the web.
Furthermore, it is essential to evaluate the success of your loyalty program. By monitoring the number of regular customers, you can gain insight into how successful your loyalty program is. Furthermore, customer feedback can help you comprehend how happy customers are with your loyalty program and how it can be improved.
Advertising EV Charging Stations
Advertising EV charging stations can be a great way for companies to make money and extend their reach. Advertisers may be able to identify a specific demographic, such as EV owners or people who are curious about electric vehicles and provide them with a dependable and convenient means to charge their cars.
Businesses may consider different types of advertisements, including digital ads, billboards, or even physical ads on the charging station itself. Businesses may also join forces with other companies to have their ads displayed on their charging station. Moreover, they may choose to create their own advertising initiatives. Or team up with local businesses to come up with a mutually beneficial campaign.
By taking advantage of promotional activities, businesses can create a reliable source of income while also offering a service to their patrons.
Public promotion of EV recharging stations
It is essential to make the public aware of EV charging station services to guarantee the long-term success of electric vehicle adoption. These services give electric vehicles a dependable supply of electricity. And help to reduce emissions and diminish reliance on fossil fuels. Advertising campaigns should be aimed at informing the public. It can be about the availability of EV refuelling services, emphasizing the advantages of using them, and furnishing incentives to convince people to switch to electric cars.
This could incorporate focused marketing, public education initiatives, and discounts or special offers on EV charging services. Also, it is vital to make sure that EV charging points are reachable, dependable, and reasonably priced.

BUSTED! 7 Electric Vehicle Myths Debunked
There are numerous myths about electric cars, and we are here to bust them. Read on to discover the reality of owning electric cars and some of the most talked about myths.
Myth #1 EVs have a limited range:
This is a common myth. But in reality, manufacturers have significantly improved electric vehicle batteries, reducing the possibility of drivers becoming stranded due to a lack of power. Modern EVs have a driving range that is more than enough to cover the daily needs of most drivers. According to research conducted using the Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure standard, the IONIQ5 can travel around 470-480 km on a single charge.
It is expected that the future of electric vehicle battery charging will be very promising. As there will be more and more charging stations popping up in different parts of the country.
Myth #2 EVs are very expensive:
It appears that the cost of electric vehicles (EVs) is likely to decline in the future. However, right now they are a bit more expensive than traditional gas-powered vehicles. On the other hand, EVs have several fiscal advantages and other discounts, and they require less maintenance, which makes them a great choice in the long run.
Myth #3 EV batteries cannot get recycled:
Automobiles with an internal combustion engine have lead-acid batteries which are highly reusable  up to around 90% in most countries. We should keep in mind that the current EV batteries are made with higher amounts of recyclable materials. These batteries are very durable, so much so that some of them can even outlast the life of the car itself.
car
Myth #4 EV batteries have a short life span:
Smartphone batteries tend to wear out after a couple of years as they need to be charged daily. On the other hand, the batteries for electric vehicles only require charging a few times each month. They are designed for smart charging, which means that the energy is distributed evenly throughout the many cells that make up the total battery pack.
Myth #5 Electric vehicles require costlier maintenance:
Despite their higher maintenance costs, electric vehicles have a lower running cost than traditional internal combustion engines (ICEs). This is because they do not necessitate frequent oil checks and oil changes, or any other kind of tuning. Furthermore, EVs have a more simplified structure with fewer parts that may need to be replaced.
Additionally, they work with one simple single-speed transmission and lack traditional components such as spark plugs, fuel tanks, valves, tailpipes, mufflers, starters, distributors, drive belts, clutches, catalytic converters, and hoses. These are the basic elements that construct the primary system of electric cars.
Myth #6 Not enough EV Chargers
Despite some skepticism about the practicality of owning an electric vehicle due to the availability of charging infrastructure, there are actually more charging points than people may realize.
In fact, in Dubai alone, there are currently 350 EV charging points. Additionally, it should be noted that most EV charging is done at home or at work on private charge points, making it easy and convenient for drivers. Therefore, many EV drivers rarely need to use public charging points and instead rely on charging their vehicles at home. For quick & hassle-free EV charger installation at home , talk to our experts today.

Myth #7 EVs are too slow to charge:
Contrary to the opinion that electric vehicles (EVs) are slow to charge, they are actually quicker by the day. With DC Ultrafast Chargers and battery technology getting better, slow charging will soon be a thing of the past. You can still choose a home charger to plug in your car and let it charge while you sleep.
Conclusion
In conclusion, it is clear that using electric vehicles is much simpler than one may think. They are secure, dependable, and effortless to manage and maintain, all while being environmentally friendly. Dont forget to check out How to pick the right Electric Vehicle for yourself in UAE .

5 Factors That Affect Your EVs Charging Speed
If you power up your electric car, you might observe that you dont always receive the quickest charging rate that your automaker or the charger promised you. On different days, you also might find out that you are getting different charging speeds.
Why does it happen?
The answer is simple. Charging an electric vehicle is more similar to charging your phone than fuelling your vehicle at a gas station.
While every EV is different, here are five factors that affect charging speed:
The State of Charge (SoC) is an indicator of the amount of power left in your battery when you begin to charge it; its equivalent to a fuel gauge.
The State of Charge (SoC)
When your SoC is low, it is much easier for electrons to fill up the seats; in contrast, when your SoC is high, it takes longer for the electrons to find an available spot, thus slowing down the charging process.
Think of it as a movie theatre. When its empty, finding a seat is much simpler than when its full and you have to search for an opening and climb over peoples legs without spilling their popcorn. Similarly, the SoC of a battery affects the speed of the charging.
battery
The temperature of your EV affects recharging speed
The temperature of your EV
Generally, batteries need to be kept at a temperature that is neither too hot nor too cold. This is to protect the battery and maintain its health. An Electric Vehicle (EV) will have a Battery Management System (BMS) that is like the batterys brain, which monitors the batterys safety. Extreme temperatures can affect a batterys life expectancy.
Most EVs come with a thermal management system, which controls the temperature of the battery for it to stay at an optimum level. However, the outside weather can still influence the battery. If it is very hot or the battery has been charging for a long time and is heating up, the charging speed will be slower. Likewise, if it is freezing cold, the charging pace will also be slower.
Using your EV while recharging
If you stay in your car during fast charging, it is important to be aware that some of the energy that should be going to the battery is instead used up by cabin air conditioning, heating, lights, radio, and other accessories. Additionally, the thermal management system also utilizes some of the charging power to regulate the temperature of the battery. This is why it may seem like the kW display on the charger is a bit higher than what the in-dash displays show.
Battery deterioration
Over time, batteries can deteriorate and lose their charging capacity. As a rule of thumb, it is recommended to stop charging when the SoC reaches 80-85%. This not only prevents the battery from becoming too hot but also saves time as the charging rate decreases when the battery is close to being full.
Your vehicles current and voltage limits
Regardless of your EVs charging capacity, it has a max rate of charge it can take in. This maximum charge rate (also known as the voltage limit) is set for the vehicle. For example, if the EV has a maximum charging speed of 7 kW and the charger can give out 22 kW, the EV will still only draw energy at the rate of 7 kW. The opposite is also true, if the EV is able to take 15 kW but the charger can only provide 7 kW, the car will again only draw energy at 7 kW.
Overall, there are many factors that can affect your EV recharging speed, from the type of charger you are using to the temperature of the battery.

Dont Get Stuck: Keep Up with Regular EV Charger Maintenance
Electric vehicles (EVs) are gaining popularity in the UAE as people seek eco-friendly and cost-effective transportation. However, owning an EV also means investing in an EV charger, and like any other electrical appliance, regular maintenance is essential to ensure it functions efficiently and safely. This blog will discuss the importance of regular maintenance for your EV charger in the UAE.
Heres What Regular Maintenance Involves
Some of the common maintenance tasks for an EV charger may include inspecting the unit for physical damage, checking electrical connections and wiring for signs of wear, and cleaning the charging ports to ensure they remain free from debris or corrosion.
Additionally, software updates may be necessary to ensure the charger is functioning with the latest security features and improvements. Its also important to have a qualified electrician periodically inspect the charger to ensure that it is correctly grounded and that all electrical connections are safe and secure.
Keeps the charger operating safely
Regular maintenance of your EV charger will ensure that it is functioning safely. Over time, wear and tear can cause the charger to become faulty, which could lead to electrical hazards, such as short circuits or electrical shocks. Regular maintenance can detect potential issues and prevent them from becoming major problems.
Increases the lifespan of the charger
Regular maintenance of the EV charger can help increase its lifespan. By keeping the charger clean and free of dust and debris, you can avoid overheating and other damage caused by a lack of maintenance. Proper cleaning and lubrication of the mechanical components can also help prevent wear and tear, extending the chargers life.
Reduces repair costs
Regular maintenance can help reduce the cost of repairs. Identifying and fixing issues early on can prevent small problems from becoming bigger and more expensive ones. In addition, regular maintenance can help avoid emergency repairs, which can be more costly than scheduled maintenance.
Improves efficiency
Regular maintenance can help improve the efficiency of your EV charger. If the charger is not operating efficiently, it could lead to longer charging times or even a decrease in charging capacity. By keeping the charger well-maintained, you can ensure that it is operating at optimal efficiency.
Maintains warranty
Regular maintenance is often required to maintain the warranty on the EV charger. Failing to follow the manufacturers recommended maintenance schedule could void the warranty. Therefore, it is important to keep records of all maintenance activities to prove that the charger has been well-maintained.
In conclusion, regular maintenance of your EV charger is essential to ensure its safety, efficiency, and longevity. With proper maintenance, you can avoid costly repairs, improve the lifespan of the charger, and keep it operating efficiently.

5 Factors That Affect Your EVs Charging Speed
If you power up your electric car, you might observe that you dont always receive the quickest charging rate that your automaker or the charger promised you. On different days, you also might find out that you are getting different charging speeds.
Why does it happen?
The answer is simple. Charging an electric vehicle is more similar to charging your phone than fuelling your vehicle at a gas station.
While every EV is different, here are five factors that affect charging speed:
The State of Charge (SoC) is an indicator of the amount of power left in your battery when you begin to charge it; its equivalent to a fuel gauge.
The State of Charge (SoC)
When your SoC is low, it is much easier for electrons to fill up the seats; in contrast, when your SoC is high, it takes longer for the electrons to find an available spot, thus slowing down the charging process.
Think of it as a movie theatre. When its empty, finding a seat is much simpler than when its full and you have to search for an opening and climb over peoples legs without spilling their popcorn. Similarly, the SoC of a battery affects the speed of the charging.
battery
The temperature of your EV affects recharging speed
The temperature of your EV
Generally, batteries need to be kept at a temperature that is neither too hot nor too cold. This is to protect the battery and maintain its health. An Electric Vehicle (EV) will have a Battery Management System (BMS) that is like the batterys brain, which monitors the batterys safety. Extreme temperatures can affect a batterys life expectancy.
Most EVs come with a thermal management system, which controls the temperature of the battery for it to stay at an optimum level. However, the outside weather can still influence the battery. If it is very hot or the battery has been charging for a long time and is heating up, the charging speed will be slower. Likewise, if it is freezing cold, the charging pace will also be slower.
Using your EV while recharging
If you stay in your car during fast charging, it is important to be aware that some of the energy that should be going to the battery is instead used up by cabin air conditioning, heating, lights, radio, and other accessories. Additionally, the thermal management system also utilizes some of the charging power to regulate the temperature of the battery. This is why it may seem like the kW display on the charger is a bit higher than what the in-dash displays show.
Battery deterioration
Over time, batteries can deteriorate and lose their charging capacity. As a rule of thumb, it is recommended to stop charging when the SoC reaches 80-85%. This not only prevents the battery from becoming too hot but also saves time as the charging rate decreases when the battery is close to being full.
Your vehicles current and voltage limits
Regardless of your EVs charging capacity, it has a max rate of charge it can take in. This maximum charge rate (also known as the voltage limit) is set for the vehicle. For example, if the EV has a maximum charging speed of 7 kW and the charger can give out 22 kW, the EV will still only draw energy at the rate of 7 kW. The opposite is also true, if the EV is able to take 15 kW but the charger can only provide 7 kW, the car will again only draw energy at 7 kW.
Overall, there are many factors that can affect your EV recharging speed, from the type of charger you are using to the temperature of the battery.

To help you budget your monthly charging costs, weve broken down the figures so you know what to expect.
As the name implies, an electric vehicle (EV) is one that operates on electricity instead of fossil fuels like in a traditional car. The benefits of driving a car that runs solely on electricity are many.
The cost to charge an electric car can vary depending on several factors including where you live, whether you own your charging station, and how many miles your car gets per charge (e.g., city or highway). Many variables affect the final cost, but we can give you a ballpark estimate as well as insights into some ways you can reduce the cost of recharging your EV.
Lets take a look.
Most Electric Vehicle (EV) owners are concerned about the high initial costs and usually forget about the long-term savings that come from charging their car at home or the workplace.
Did you know: In typical circumstances, it costs 7x less to drive an EV for a month as compared to a traditional car
How much does it cost to charge an Electric Vehicle (EV) ?
How much does it cost to charge an Electric Vehicle
?
The best way to calculate this on your own is by dividing your electric bill by the total number of Kilowatts used per hour (kWh). Then take how many kWh your vehicle runs on and multiply that by how much you typically pay in electricity per hour.
Another way to consider how much you will likely pay to charge your EV is by breaking it down by the mathematical statement: The electricity cost per day is equal to the energy consumption, E, in kWh per day multiplied by the energy cost of 1 kWh in AED per kWh.
Cost(AED/day) = E(kWh/day)  Cost(AED/kWh)
Where do you live?
The cost to charge an Electric Vehicle (EV) at home is typically lower than at work, as the cost of electricity is much lower here. If you charge at home, you also have to factor in the cost of buying and installing a home charging unit.
While some EVs come with an onboard charger with a cable, most people prefer to have a dedicated home charger so that their car can charge at a much higher speed and is also much safer.
How many km will your Electric Vehicle get per charge?
The amount of electricity you use per km depends on the type of EV youre charging with. For example, if youre charging your EV with a Level 1 or Level 2 charging station (typically around 8 hours to 80%), the cost per kWh is around 0.38 AED.
If you want to charge your EV at a public charging station, youll have to pay a fixed fee per kWh set by the Utility provider (DEWA, FEWA, ADDC, AADC, etc.) for the electricity you use. Typically, this fee corresponds to around 6.7 AED/hr for AC chargers, depending on the station. If you charge at a DC Fast charger, the cost is usually around 46 AED/Hr at a 150kW unit.
How much electricity is available where you live to charge an Electric Vehicle?
The UAE Power Market is segmented by Power Generation (Natural Gas, Nuclear, and Renewables), and Transmission and Distribution. In areas that have warm summers and cold winters, renewable energy such as solar, wind, and geothermal power is getting cheaper and more accessible.
Electric Vehicle Chargers at Work and Home
Chargers at Work and Home
When you charge your EV at home, you can often choose from a few different types of charging stations depending on your homes wiring and available capacity. If you charge at work, most workplaces may have shared charging stations.
Bottom Line
How much charging your EV costs you have various factors. If you want to charge at home or work you can expect to pay 0.38 AED per kWh. If youd like to charge your EV at public charging stations, youll have to pay a fixed fee per kWh as per the tariff set by the Network. If you live in a premium property, the cost of charging can be higher as there will be a premium charged on the parking. As of today, the tariff is regulated by the utility providers in the country and we shall see how the policy moves over the coming months.

EV Charging Stations 101: Which Type Is Right for You?
Electric vehicles (EVs) have been gaining popularity in recent years as people become more environmentally conscious. As a result, there has been an increase in the number of charging stations across the country. However, with so many options available, it can be challenging to know which type of EV charging station is right for you. In this blog, we will explore the different types of EV charging stations and help you determine which one suits your needs.
Level 1 EV Charging Station

6 Essential Tips for Hot Weather EV Driving
With the summer months upon us, electric vehicle (EV) owners may be wondering how to keep their cars running smoothly in the heat. Whether youre a seasoned EV owner or a newbie, its crucial to know how to maintain your vehicle properly during the summer months.
So, buckle up and get ready to learn how to keep your EV running like a dream this summer!
1. Use the ECO mode
Most modern electric vehicles have an eco mode. In addition to saving mileage, this feature reduces the energy used for other functions that consume charge behind the scenes such as air conditioner. The sophisticated feature also improves acceleration, dampens throttle response, and saves valuable battery power.
2. Only charge to 80% capacity
Only charge to 80% capacity
Industry experts say charging between 20% and 80% is the norm for keeping the battery in good shape, especially at high temperatures. Just like your cell phone, the battery gets hotter the longer you charge it. Combined with the sunny weather, this can lead to battery dissatisfaction (not to mention the increased risk of premature battery degradation).
3. Do not charge your EV immediately after driving
Do not charge your EV immediately after driving
Electric vehicle batteries are hot from previous rides, so it is not recommended to charge them too soon (especially if the charger has been exposed to direct sunlight). The best time to charge an EV is at night or early in the morning when temperatures are cooler. In addition, the charging fee is cheaper because it is not charged during the busy season!
4. Shadow is EVs best friend
Shadow is EVs best friend
The easiest and most obvious (and perhaps the most important tip!) is to avoid parking in direct sunlight. Park in a shaded area instead. Unless your electric car is left in the sun for long periods of time (and legally parked!), whether its under a tree, garage, or anywhere else, it helps protect the battery from overheating (and, the electric car does not consume much energy during cooling, so the cruising range can also be maximized!). Your car can get burned if it sits in the sun all day, Youll want to turn the A/C on full blast just to endure it. A sunshade windshield cover can also help.
5. Try EV Preconditioning
Try EV Preconditioning
Preconditioning is a popular feature for warming the interior of electric vehicles during cold weather. However, it also helps in summer. If your electric vehicle has a preconditioning function, you can remotely pre-cool the cabin before you get into the vehicle. This not only increases range by regulating electric vehicles to the optimum temperature to prevent overloading all day long but also makes for a more comfortable and sweat-free driving experience.
It also saves time by allowing you to pre-condition your EV before you travel. So you dont waste time blowing your air conditioner or fogging up your windows  a win-win solution! Tesla is one of the most used EVs with this feature. You can even set it up remotely via an app, so you dont have to leave your home!
6. Use fewer applications while driving
Have you ever noticed that when you open multiple applications on your phone, your device gets hot and slows down? EV batteries do the same. The more background processes your electric car runs, the hotter the battery gets.
When driving in hot weather, it is recommended to close some of these external applications if they are not important. Gaming apps, text messaging, and music streaming services running in electric vehicle software are just a few of the features that can be shut down to conserve vehicle battery life.
With these simple tips, you can make the most of your EV during the summer.

EV Charging Stations 101: Which Type Is Right for You?
Electric vehicles (EVs) have been gaining popularity in recent years as people become more environmentally conscious. As a result, there has been an increase in the number of charging stations across the country. However, with so many options available, it can be challenging to know which type of EV charging station is right for you. In this blog, we will explore the different types of EV charging stations and help you determine which one suits your needs.
Level 1 EV Charging Station
Lets start with the basics: Level 1 charging stations. These chargers are the most straightforward and cost-effective option available. They typically use a standard 120-volt outlet, which can be found in most homes and garages. Level 1 charging stations offer a charging rate of around 4 to 5 miles of range per hour, making them perfect for people who dont drive much or have a lot of time to charge.
AC EV Charging Stations
AC charging stations, also known as Level 2 chargers, are the most common type of charging station youll find. They use an AC power source to charge your EVs battery, and they can be found in both residential and commercial locations. AC chargers are perfect for daily charging needs, as they provide a charging rate of around 25-30 miles per hour. They are also relatively affordable and easy to install, making them an excellent option for most EV owners.
DC EV Charging Stations
DC charging stations, also known as Level 3 or fast chargers, are the most potent and fastest charging option available. They use a direct current (DC) power source to charge your EVs battery and can deliver a whopping 80% charge in as little as 20-30 minutes! However, DC charging stations are much more expensive than AC chargers and require a specialized installation. DC charging stations are ideal for those who need a quick charge on the go, such as long-distance travelers.
Which One is Right for You?
Determining which type of charger is right for you depends on your individual needs. If you have a daily commute or use your EV for short trips around town, an AC charging station is likely sufficient. However, if you frequently travel long distances, a DC charging station may be necessary to keep up with your charging
In conclusion
Choosing the right EV charging station can seem overwhelming, but with a little research and consideration, you can find the perfect charging solution for your needs. Remember to take into account your driving habits, the amount of time you have to charge, and your budget before making a decision. Whatever your choice, youll be doing your part to help the environment and reduce your carbon footprint.

EV boom in the UAE- 2023 Looks a Whole lot Greener
2023 will be pivotal for the automotive industry due to the impending EV boom. Governments worldwide demand sustainable transportation due to high climate change concerns, including the UAE. In this blog, well take a closer look at why 2023 is set to be the year of the EV boom and what this means for the UAE.
One of the key factors driving the growth of EVs is the falling cost of batteries. With advancements in battery technology, the cost of producing EVs has come down significantly over the past few years. As a result, EVs are becoming more affordable for consumers, and were seeing a surge in demand for these vehicles. In fact, many experts predict that by 2023, the cost of owning an EV will be on par with that of a traditional gasoline-powered vehicle.
Another factor driving the EV boom is government policies and incentives. The UAE government is to install 3,000+ public charging stations by 2023 with significant investments in EV charging infrastructure. Additionally, the government has introduced a range of incentives to encourage consumers to switch to EVs, including tax breaks and free parking.
The rise of ride-hailing services is also playing a role in the EV boom. Companies like Uber and Careem have pledged to make their fleets fully electric by 2030, which is driving demand for EVs in the commercial sector. This, in turn, is putting pressure on automakers to increase production of EVs to meet demand.
So, what does all of this mean for the UAE?
Well, for starters, it means that the country is well-positioned to become a leader in the global EV market. The UAE charges ahead to an electrified future with ambitious EV infra and incentives, nurturing a sustainable ecosystem. This, in turn, is attracting investors and startups to the region, which could lead to the creation of new jobs and economic growth.
Furthermore, the EV boom is good news for the environment. EVs can significantly cut UAEs carbon footprint and support sustainability goals via emissions reduction.
boom
2023 is shaping up to be a pivotal year for the EV industry. With falling battery costs, government policies, and the rise of ride-hailing services all driving demand for these vehicles, the stage is set for a surge in EV sales. For the UAE, this presents an opportunity to become a leader in the global EV market and make significant progress toward its sustainability goals.

Renting vs. Buying an Electric Car
Renting vs buying an EV. Lets have a closer look. As the world continues to shift towards sustainable energy, electric vehicles have become an increasingly popular choice for environmentally conscious drivers.
However, with the high cost of purchasing an electric vehicle, many are left wondering whether its better to buy or rent. While buying offers the long-term benefits of ownership and potential savings, leasing provides a more affordable and flexible option with the ability to upgrade to newer models.
Its a dilemma that many are facing when it comes to electric vehicles, and the decision ultimately depends on individual circumstances and priorities.
In this blog, well explore the factors to consider when deciding whether to buy or rent an electric vehicle, so you can make an informed decision that suits your needs and budget.
Lets understand the difference between buying & renting an EV
Deciding between leasing or buying your next vehicle is a straightforward process.
If you prefer changing your car frequently and dont mind the limitations on mileage, leasing can be a great option. On the other hand, if you value the independence of owning a car, purchasing is the best choice.
Things to consider before making a decision- buying or renting an EV
Your Lifestyle
Before making a decision, ask yourself why are you specifically considering an EV. You need to keep in mind if youre going to travel short distances or long distances.
If youre just looking for a more sustainable option for a vehicle or just want to get a hang of the driving experience then renting is a more viable option for you. But if youre looking for a long-term noise-free driving experience, govt subsidies or simple before electricity is relatively cheaper than fuel then buying an EV is the way to go.
Your Finances
Before you come to a decision, check your financial situation and list which option is more viable for you in the longer run.
If you have enough savings to pay for a relatively large down payment, you can save a lot on your monthly payments and your future self will appreciate buying an electric car.
However, if you have a long-term savings plan but dont want to pay high upfront costs or high monthly payments, leasing may be the best option for you. Maintain your current lifestyle and savings while having access to a vehicle you can trust.
vehicle
Your Mindset
Buying an EV right now is a little expensive option but post-purchase benefits are numerous. Its more sustainable, no fuel is required so you save money on gas. It is environmentally friendly as they do not emit pollutants. The maintenance is low due to an efficient electric motor and of course, the performance is better. But all these options have long term commitment.
If youre an automobile enthusiast whod want to get the latest model of car with each passing year, renting is the best option for you.
Currently, purchasing an electric vehicle comes at a significant cost, which also results in a higher cost for car insurance. However, opting for short-term rental of an EV can be a viable option for those interested in testing it out for an extended period. Renting a car could also be a practical choice for those who anticipate minimal driving in their personal vehicle.

Energizing Change: Saudi Arabias Strategy to Electrify the Auto Industry
Introduction
In an era where sustainability is not just a choice but a necessity, nations around the globe are pivoting towards greener alternatives. Among these, electric vehicles (EVs) stand out as a beacon of sustainable transportation.
Saudi Arabia, traditionally known for its vast oil reserves, is now charting a new course toward becoming a linchpin in the EV manufacturing sector. This ambitious pivot not only aligns with the global shift towards renewable energy but also opens a new chapter for companies like Regeny, a specialized EV charging solutions provider.
As we explore Saudi Arabias foray into EV manufacturing, we delve into the synergy between innovation in EV production and the imperative for advanced charging infrastructure, underscoring Regenys vision of a seamless transition to electric mobility.
Saudi Arabias Vision for EV Manufacturing
At the heart of Saudi Arabias diversification strategy lies its commitment to becoming a significant player in the global EV market. This vision is embodied by the emergence of companies like Ceer and Lucid, which are at the forefront of Saudi Arabias EV manufacturing ambitions. Ceer, the kingdoms first EV brand, signifies a monumental step towards realizing Saudi Vision 2030s sustainability objectives.
Lucid Motors, with substantial Saudi investment, is another testament to the kingdoms serious intent in this arena. These initiatives are not mere industrial ventures but a clear indication of Saudi Arabias strategic focus on innovative technologies that promise a sustainable future.
Challenges Facing Saudi Arabias EV Ambitions
Embarking on the journey to become an EV manufacturing hub, Saudi Arabia faces a multifaceted set of challenges. Technical and logistical hurdles are paramount, from establishing advanced manufacturing facilities to ensuring the supply chain can support EV production.
The transition also demands a robust framework for international partnerships and local talent cultivation to foster innovation and sustain growth. Moreover, regulatory environments and infrastructure must evolve to support not just the manufacturing of EVs but also their widespread adoption.
These challenges are significant, yet they offer a unique opportunity for Saudi Arabia to position itself as a leader in sustainable automotive technology .

4. Empowering Individuals with Energy Independence:
Imagine never worrying about fluctuating fuel prices or being tied to the limitations of traditional gas stations. EV charger installation empowers individuals with energy independence, granting them the freedom to charge their vehicles at their convenience, be it at home, work, or public charging stations.
The ability to charge an electric vehicle at home not only simplifies daily life but also encourages more people to adopt EVs, knowing that they have a reliable and accessible charging solution wherever they go.
5. Leading by an Electric Example:
Governments play a vital role in leading by example. By integrating electric vehicles into their official fleets and encouraging public sector organizations to adopt EVs, they send a powerful message of commitment to sustainability and environmental stewardship.
When citizens witness their leaders actively supporting EV adoption, it inspires confidence and trust in the transition to a clean energy future.
In conclusion
As the UAE embraces the vision of smart cities and governments, the importance of installing EV chargers cannot be overstated.
Regeny takes immense pride in contributing to this transformative movement, providing cutting-edge EV charger solutions that lay the foundation for a cleaner, more sustainable future.
Together, let us drive towards a world where smart cities thrive, governments lead by example, and individuals enjoy the benefits of energy independence and a greener planet.

EV boom in the UAE- 2023 Looks a Whole lot Greener
2023 will be pivotal for the automotive industry due to the impending EV boom. Governments worldwide demand sustainable transportation due to high climate change concerns, including the UAE. In this blog, well take a closer look at why 2023 is set to be the year of the EV boom and what this means for the UAE.
One of the key factors driving the growth of EVs is the falling cost of batteries. With advancements in battery technology, the cost of producing EVs has come down significantly over the past few years. As a result, EVs are becoming more affordable for consumers, and were seeing a surge in demand for these vehicles. In fact, many experts predict that by 2023, the cost of owning an EV will be on par with that of a traditional gasoline-powered vehicle.
Another factor driving the EV boom is government policies and incentives. The UAE government is to install 3,000+ public charging stations by 2023 with significant investments in EV charging infrastructure. Additionally, the government has introduced a range of incentives to encourage consumers to switch to EVs, including tax breaks and free parking.
The rise of ride-hailing services is also playing a role in the EV boom. Companies like Uber and Careem have pledged to make their fleets fully electric by 2030, which is driving demand for EVs in the commercial sector. This, in turn, is putting pressure on automakers to increase production of EVs to meet demand.
So, what does all of this mean for the UAE?
Well, for starters, it means that the country is well-positioned to become a leader in the global EV market. The UAE charges ahead to an electrified future with ambitious EV infra and incentives, nurturing a sustainable ecosystem. This, in turn, is attracting investors and startups to the region, which could lead to the creation of new jobs and economic growth.
Furthermore, the EV boom is good news for the environment. EVs can significantly cut UAEs carbon footprint and support sustainability goals via emissions reduction.

In conclusion
2023 is shaping up to be a pivotal year for the EV industry. With falling battery costs, government policies, and the rise of ride-hailing services all driving demand for these vehicles, the stage is set for a surge in EV sales. For the UAE, this presents an opportunity to become a leader in the global EV market and make significant progress toward its sustainability goals.

EV Charging Stations 101: Which Type Is Right for You?
Electric vehicles (EVs) have been gaining popularity in recent years as people become more environmentally conscious. As a result, there has been an increase in the number of charging stations across the country. However, with so many options available, it can be challenging to know which type of EV charging station is right for you. In this blog, we will explore the different types of EV charging stations and help you determine which one suits your needs.
Level 1 EV Charging Station
Lets start with the basics: Level 1 charging stations. These chargers are the most straightforward and cost-effective option available. They typically use a standard 120-volt outlet, which can be found in most homes and garages. Level 1 charging stations offer a charging rate of around 4 to 5 miles of range per hour, making them perfect for people who dont drive much or have a lot of time to charge.
AC EV Charging Stations
AC charging stations, also known as Level 2 chargers, are the most common type of charging station youll find. They use an AC power source to charge your EVs battery, and they can be found in both residential and commercial locations. AC chargers are perfect for daily charging needs, as they provide a charging rate of around 25-30 miles per hour. They are also relatively affordable and easy to install, making them an excellent option for most EV owners.
DC EV Charging Stations
DC charging stations, also known as Level 3 or fast chargers, are the most potent and fastest charging option available. They use a direct current (DC) power source to charge your EVs battery and can deliver a whopping 80% charge in as little as 20-30 minutes! However, DC charging stations are much more expensive than AC chargers and require a specialized installation. DC charging stations are ideal for those who need a quick charge on the go, such as long-distance travelers.
Which One is Right for You?
Determining which type of charger is right for you depends on your individual needs. If you have a daily commute or use your EV for short trips around town, an AC charging station is likely sufficient. However, if you frequently travel long distances, a DC charging station may be necessary to keep up with your charging
In conclusion
Choosing the right EV charging station can seem overwhelming, but with a little research and consideration, you can find the perfect charging solution for your needs. Remember to take into account your driving habits, the amount of time you have to charge, and your budget before making a decision. Whatever your choice, youll be doing your part to help the environment and reduce your carbon footprint.

6 Essential Tips for Hot Weather EV Driving
With the summer months upon us, electric vehicle (EV) owners may be wondering how to keep their cars running smoothly in the heat. Whether youre a seasoned EV owner or a newbie, its crucial to know how to maintain your vehicle properly during the summer months.
So, buckle up and get ready to learn how to keep your EV running like a dream this summer!
1. Use the ECO mode
Most modern electric vehicles have an eco mode. In addition to saving mileage, this feature reduces the energy used for other functions that consume charge behind the scenes such as air conditioner. The sophisticated feature also improves acceleration, dampens throttle response, and saves valuable battery power.
2. Only charge to 80% capacity
Only charge to 80% capacity
Industry experts say charging between 20% and 80% is the norm for keeping the battery in good shape, especially at high temperatures. Just like your cell phone, the battery gets hotter the longer you charge it. Combined with the sunny weather, this can lead to battery dissatisfaction (not to mention the increased risk of premature battery degradation).
3. Do not charge your EV immediately after driving
Do not charge your EV immediately after driving
Electric vehicle batteries are hot from previous rides, so it is not recommended to charge them too soon (especially if the charger has been exposed to direct sunlight). The best time to charge an EV is at night or early in the morning when temperatures are cooler. In addition, the charging fee is cheaper because it is not charged during the busy season!
4. Shadow is EVs best friend
Shadow is EVs best friend
The easiest and most obvious (and perhaps the most important tip!) is to avoid parking in direct sunlight. Park in a shaded area instead. Unless your electric car is left in the sun for long periods of time (and legally parked!), whether its under a tree, garage, or anywhere else, it helps protect the battery from overheating (and, the electric car does not consume much energy during cooling, so the cruising range can also be maximized!). Your car can get burned if it sits in the sun all day, Youll want to turn the A/C on full blast just to endure it. A sunshade windshield cover can also help.
5. Try EV Preconditioning
Try EV Preconditioning
Preconditioning is a popular feature for warming the interior of electric vehicles during cold weather. However, it also helps in summer. If your electric vehicle has a preconditioning function, you can remotely pre-cool the cabin before you get into the vehicle. This not only increases range by regulating electric vehicles to the optimum temperature to prevent overloading all day long but also makes for a more comfortable and sweat-free driving experience.
It also saves time by allowing you to pre-condition your EV before you travel. So you dont waste time blowing your air conditioner or fogging up your windows  a win-win solution! Tesla is one of the most used EVs with this feature. You can even set it up remotely via an app, so you dont have to leave your home!
6. Use fewer applications while driving
Have you ever noticed that when you open multiple applications on your phone, your device gets hot and slows down? EV batteries do the same. The more background processes your electric car runs, the hotter the battery gets.
When driving in hot weather, it is recommended to close some of these external applications if they are not important. Gaming apps, text messaging, and music streaming services running in electric vehicle software are just a few of the features that can be shut down to conserve vehicle battery life.
With these simple tips, you can make the most of your EV during the summer.

6 Essential Tips for Hot Weather EV Driving
With the summer months upon us, electric vehicle (EV) owners may be wondering how to keep their cars running smoothly in the heat. Whether youre a seasoned EV owner or a newbie, its crucial to know how to maintain your vehicle properly during the summer months.
So, buckle up and get ready to learn how to keep your EV running like a dream this summer!
1. Use the ECO mode
Most modern electric vehicles have an eco mode. In addition to saving mileage, this feature reduces the energy used for other functions that consume charge behind the scenes such as air conditioner. The sophisticated feature also improves acceleration, dampens throttle response, and saves valuable battery power.
2. Only charge to 80% capacity
Only charge to 80% capacity
Industry experts say charging between 20% and 80% is the norm for keeping the battery in good shape, especially at high temperatures. Just like your cell phone, the battery gets hotter the longer you charge it. Combined with the sunny weather, this can lead to battery dissatisfaction (not to mention the increased risk of premature battery degradation).
3. Do not charge your EV immediately after driving
Do not charge your EV immediately after driving
Electric vehicle batteries are hot from previous rides, so it is not recommended to charge them too soon (especially if the charger has been exposed to direct sunlight). The best time to charge an EV is at night or early in the morning when temperatures are cooler. In addition, the charging fee is cheaper because it is not charged during the busy season!
4. Shadow is EVs best friend
Shadow is EVs best friend
The easiest and most obvious (and perhaps the most important tip!) is to avoid parking in direct sunlight. Park in a shaded area instead. Unless your electric car is left in the sun for long periods of time (and legally parked!), whether its under a tree, garage, or anywhere else, it helps protect the battery from overheating (and, the electric car does not consume much energy during cooling, so the cruising range can also be maximized!). Your car can get burned if it sits in the sun all day, Youll want to turn the A/C on full blast just to endure it. A sunshade windshield cover can also help.
5. Try EV Preconditioning
Try EV Preconditioning
Preconditioning is a popular feature for warming the interior of electric vehicles during cold weather. However, it also helps in summer. If your electric vehicle has a preconditioning function, you can remotely pre-cool the cabin before you get into the vehicle. This not only increases range by regulating electric vehicles to the optimum temperature to prevent overloading all day long but also makes for a more comfortable and sweat-free driving experience.
It also saves time by allowing you to pre-condition your EV before you travel. So you dont waste time blowing your air conditioner or fogging up your windows  a win-win solution! Tesla is one of the most used EVs with this feature. You can even set it up remotely via an app, so you dont have to leave your home!
6. Use fewer applications while driving
Have you ever noticed that when you open multiple applications on your phone, your device gets hot and slows down? EV batteries do the same. The more background processes your electric car runs, the hotter the battery gets.
When driving in hot weather, it is recommended to close some of these external applications if they are not important. Gaming apps, text messaging, and music streaming services running in electric vehicle software are just a few of the features that can be shut down to conserve vehicle battery life.
With these simple tips, you can make the most of your EV during the summer.

The State of Charge (SoC) is an indicator of the amount of power left in your battery when you begin to charge it; its equivalent to a fuel gauge.

When your SoC is low, it is much easier for electrons to fill up the seats; in contrast, when your SoC is high, it takes longer for the electrons to find an available spot, thus slowing down the charging process.
Think of it as a movie theatre. When its empty, finding a seat is much simpler than when its full and you have to search for an opening and climb over peoples legs without spilling their popcorn. Similarly, the SoC of a battery affects the speed of the charging.

The temperature of your EV affects recharging speed
The temperature of your EV
Generally, batteries need to be kept at a temperature that is neither too hot nor too cold. This is to protect the battery and maintain its health. An Electric Vehicle (EV) will have a Battery Management System (BMS) that is like the batterys brain, which monitors the batterys safety. Extreme temperatures can affect a batterys life expectancy.
Most EVs come with a thermal management system, which controls the temperature of the battery for it to stay at an optimum level. However, the outside weather can still influence the battery. If it is very hot or the battery has been charging for a long time and is heating up, the charging speed will be slower. Likewise, if it is freezing cold, the charging pace will also be slower.
Using your EV while recharging
If you stay in your car during fast charging, it is important to be aware that some of the energy that should be going to the battery is instead used up by cabin air conditioning, heating, lights, radio, and other accessories. Additionally, the thermal management system also utilizes some of the charging power to regulate the temperature of the battery. This is why it may seem like the kW display on the charger is a bit higher than what the in-dash displays show.
Battery deterioration
Over time, batteries can deteriorate and lose their charging capacity. As a rule of thumb, it is recommended to stop charging when the SoC reaches 80-85%. This not only prevents the battery from becoming too hot but also saves time as the charging rate decreases when the battery is close to being full.
Your vehicles current and voltage limits
Regardless of your EVs charging capacity, it has a max rate of charge it can take in. This maximum charge rate (also known as the voltage limit) is set for the vehicle. For example, if the EV has a maximum charging speed of 7 kW and the charger can give out 22 kW, the EV will still only draw energy at the rate of 7 kW. The opposite is also true, if the EV is able to take 15 kW but the charger can only provide 7 kW, the car will again only draw energy at 7 kW.
Overall, there are many factors that can affect your EV recharging speed, from the type of charger you are using to the temperature of the battery.

Electric vehicle: How Much Does it Cost to Charge?
Owning an Electric Vehicle (EV) is an exciting step towards a greener world. Utility companies and private enterprises are rushing to provide charging stations and affordable electric cars to keep up with the growing demand. But how much does it cost to charge an Electric Vehicle?
To help you budget your monthly charging costs, weve broken down the figures so you know what to expect.
As the name implies, an electric vehicle (EV) is one that operates on electricity instead of fossil fuels like in a traditional car. The benefits of driving a car that runs solely on electricity are many.
The cost to charge an electric car can vary depending on several factors including where you live, whether you own your charging station, and how many miles your car gets per charge (e.g., city or highway). Many variables affect the final cost, but we can give you a ballpark estimate as well as insights into some ways you can reduce the cost of recharging your EV.
Lets take a look.
Most Electric Vehicle (EV) owners are concerned about the high initial costs and usually forget about the long-term savings that come from charging their car at home or the workplace.
Did you know: In typical circumstances, it costs 7x less to drive an EV for a month as compared to a traditional car
How much does it cost to charge an Electric Vehicle (EV) ?
How much does it cost to charge an Electric Vehicle
?
The best way to calculate this on your own is by dividing your electric bill by the total number of Kilowatts used per hour (kWh). Then take how many kWh your vehicle runs on and multiply that by how much you typically pay in electricity per hour.
Another way to consider how much you will likely pay to charge your EV is by breaking it down by the mathematical statement: The electricity cost per day is equal to the energy consumption, E, in kWh per day multiplied by the energy cost of 1 kWh in AED per kWh.
Cost(AED/day) = E(kWh/day)  Cost(AED/kWh)
Where do you live?
The cost to charge an Electric Vehicle (EV) at home is typically lower than at work, as the cost of electricity is much lower here. If you charge at home, you also have to factor in the cost of buying and installing a home charging unit.
While some EVs come with an onboard charger with a cable, most people prefer to have a dedicated home charger so that their car can charge at a much higher speed and is also much safer.
How many km will your Electric Vehicle get per charge?
The amount of electricity you use per km depends on the type of EV youre charging with. For example, if youre charging your EV with a Level 1 or Level 2 charging station (typically around 8 hours to 80%), the cost per kWh is around 0.38 AED.
If you want to charge your EV at a public charging station, youll have to pay a fixed fee per kWh set by the Utility provider (DEWA, FEWA, ADDC, AADC, etc.) for the electricity you use. Typically, this fee corresponds to around 6.7 AED/hr for AC chargers, depending on the station. If you charge at a DC Fast charger, the cost is usually around 46 AED/Hr at a 150kW unit.
How much electricity is available where you live to charge an Electric Vehicle?
The UAE Power Market is segmented by Power Generation (Natural Gas, Nuclear, and Renewables), and Transmission and Distribution. In areas that have warm summers and cold winters, renewable energy such as solar, wind, and geothermal power is getting cheaper and more accessible.
Electric Vehicle Chargers at Work and Home
Chargers at Work and Home
When you charge your EV at home, you can often choose from a few different types of charging stations depending on your homes wiring and available capacity. If you charge at work, most workplaces may have shared charging stations.
Bottom Line
How much charging your EV costs you have various factors. If you want to charge at home or work you can expect to pay 0.38 AED per kWh. If youd like to charge your EV at public charging stations, youll have to pay a fixed fee per kWh as per the tariff set by the Network. If you live in a premium property, the cost of charging can be higher as there will be a premium charged on the parking. As of today, the tariff is regulated by the utility providers in the country and we shall see how the policy moves over the coming months.

EV Charging Stations 101: Which Type Is Right for You?
Electric vehicles (EVs) have been gaining popularity in recent years as people become more environmentally conscious. As a result, there has been an increase in the number of charging stations across the country. However, with so many options available, it can be challenging to know which type of EV charging station is right for you. In this blog, we will explore the different types of EV charging stations and help you determine which one suits your needs.
Level 1 EV Charging Station
Lets start with the basics: Level 1 charging stations. These chargers are the most straightforward and cost-effective option available. They typically use a standard 120-volt outlet, which can be found in most homes and garages. Level 1 charging stations offer a charging rate of around 4 to 5 miles of range per hour, making them perfect for people who dont drive much or have a lot of time to charge.
AC EV Charging Stations
AC charging stations, also known as Level 2 chargers, are the most common type of charging station youll find. They use an AC power source to charge your EVs battery, and they can be found in both residential and commercial locations. AC chargers are perfect for daily charging needs, as they provide a charging rate of around 25-30 miles per hour. They are also relatively affordable and easy to install, making them an excellent option for most EV owners.
DC EV Charging Stations
DC charging stations, also known as Level 3 or fast chargers, are the most potent and fastest charging option available. They use a direct current (DC) power source to charge your EVs battery and can deliver a whopping 80% charge in as little as 20-30 minutes! However, DC charging stations are much more expensive than AC chargers and require a specialized installation. DC charging stations are ideal for those who need a quick charge on the go, such as long-distance travelers.
Which One is Right for You?
Determining which type of charger is right for you depends on your individual needs. If you have a daily commute or use your EV for short trips around town, an AC charging station is likely sufficient. However, if you frequently travel long distances, a DC charging station may be necessary to keep up with your charging
In conclusion
Choosing the right EV charging station can seem overwhelming, but with a little research and consideration, you can find the perfect charging solution for your needs. Remember to take into account your driving habits, the amount of time you have to charge, and your budget before making a decision. Whatever your choice, youll be doing your part to help the environment and reduce your carbon footprint.

EV boom in the UAE- 2023 Looks a Whole lot Greener
2023 will be pivotal for the automotive industry due to the impending EV boom. Governments worldwide demand sustainable transportation due to high climate change concerns, including the UAE. In this blog, well take a closer look at why 2023 is set to be the year of the EV boom and what this means for the UAE.
One of the key factors driving the growth of EVs is the falling cost of batteries. With advancements in battery technology, the cost of producing EVs has come down significantly over the past few years. As a result, EVs are becoming more affordable for consumers, and were seeing a surge in demand for these vehicles. In fact, many experts predict that by 2023, the cost of owning an EV will be on par with that of a traditional gasoline-powered vehicle.
Another factor driving the EV boom is government policies and incentives. The UAE government is to install 3,000+ public charging stations by 2023 with significant investments in EV charging infrastructure. Additionally, the government has introduced a range of incentives to encourage consumers to switch to EVs, including tax breaks and free parking.
The rise of ride-hailing services is also playing a role in the EV boom. Companies like Uber and Careem have pledged to make their fleets fully electric by 2030, which is driving demand for EVs in the commercial sector. This, in turn, is putting pressure on automakers to increase production of EVs to meet demand.
So, what does all of this mean for the UAE?
Well, for starters, it means that the country is well-positioned to become a leader in the global EV market. The UAE charges ahead to an electrified future with ambitious EV infra and incentives, nurturing a sustainable ecosystem. This, in turn, is attracting investors and startups to the region, which could lead to the creation of new jobs and economic growth.
Furthermore, the EV boom is good news for the environment. EVs can significantly cut UAEs carbon footprint and support sustainability goals via emissions reduction.
boom
2023 is shaping up to be a pivotal year for the EV industry. With falling battery costs, government policies, and the rise of ride-hailing services all driving demand for these vehicles, the stage is set for a surge in EV sales. For the UAE, this presents an opportunity to become a leader in the global EV market and make significant progress toward its sustainability goals.

EV Maintenance
Dont Get Stuck: Keep Up with Regular EV Charger Maintenance
Electric vehicles (EVs) are gaining popularity in the UAE as people seek eco-friendly and cost-effective transportation. However, owning an EV also means investing in an EV charger, and like any other electrical appliance, regular maintenance is essential to ensure it functions efficiently and safely. This blog will discuss the importance of regular maintenance for your EV charger in the UAE.
Heres What Regular Maintenance Involves
Some of the common maintenance tasks for an EV charger may include inspecting the unit for physical damage, checking electrical connections and wiring for signs of wear, and cleaning the charging ports to ensure they remain free from debris or corrosion.
Additionally, software updates may be necessary to ensure the charger is functioning with the latest security features and improvements. Its also important to have a qualified electrician periodically inspect the charger to ensure that it is correctly grounded and that all electrical connections are safe and secure.
Keeps the charger operating safely
Regular maintenance of your EV charger will ensure that it is functioning safely. Over time, wear and tear can cause the charger to become faulty, which could lead to electrical hazards, such as short circuits or electrical shocks. Regular maintenance can detect potential issues and prevent them from becoming major problems.
Increases the lifespan of the charger
Regular maintenance of the EV charger can help increase its lifespan. By keeping the charger clean and free of dust and debris, you can avoid overheating and other damage caused by a lack of maintenance. Proper cleaning and lubrication of the mechanical components can also help prevent wear and tear, extending the chargers life.
Reduces repair costs
Regular maintenance can help reduce the cost of repairs. Identifying and fixing issues early on can prevent small problems from becoming bigger and more expensive ones. In addition, regular maintenance can help avoid emergency repairs, which can be more costly than scheduled maintenance.
Improves efficiency
Regular maintenance can help improve the efficiency of your EV charger. If the charger is not operating efficiently, it could lead to longer charging times or even a decrease in charging capacity. By keeping the charger well-maintained, you can ensure that it is operating at optimal efficiency.
Maintains warranty
Regular maintenance is often required to maintain the warranty on the EV charger. Failing to follow the manufacturers recommended maintenance schedule could void the warranty. Therefore, it is important to keep records of all maintenance activities to prove that the charger has been well-maintained.
In conclusion, regular maintenance of your EV charger is essential to ensure its safety, efficiency, and longevity. With proper maintenance, you can avoid costly repairs, improve the lifespan of the charger, and keep it operating efficiently.

6 Essential Tips for Hot Weather EV Driving
With the summer months upon us, electric vehicle (EV) owners may be wondering how to keep their cars running smoothly in the heat. Whether youre a seasoned EV owner or a newbie, its crucial to know how to maintain your vehicle properly during the summer months.
So, buckle up and get ready to learn how to keep your EV running like a dream this summer!
1. Use the ECO mode
Most modern electric vehicles have an eco mode. In addition to saving mileage, this feature reduces the energy used for other functions that consume charge behind the scenes such as air conditioner. The sophisticated feature also improves acceleration, dampens throttle response, and saves valuable battery power.
2. Only charge to 80% capacity
Only charge to 80% capacity
Industry experts say charging between 20% and 80% is the norm for keeping the battery in good shape, especially at high temperatures. Just like your cell phone, the battery gets hotter the longer you charge it. Combined with the sunny weather, this can lead to battery dissatisfaction (not to mention the increased risk of premature battery degradation).
3. Do not charge your EV immediately after driving
Do not charge your EV immediately after driving
Electric vehicle batteries are hot from previous rides, so it is not recommended to charge them too soon (especially if the charger has been exposed to direct sunlight). The best time to charge an EV is at night or early in the morning when temperatures are cooler. In addition, the charging fee is cheaper because it is not charged during the busy season!
4. Shadow is EVs best friend
Shadow is EVs best friend
The easiest and most obvious (and perhaps the most important tip!) is to avoid parking in direct sunlight. Park in a shaded area instead. Unless your electric car is left in the sun for long periods of time (and legally parked!), whether its under a tree, garage, or anywhere else, it helps protect the battery from overheating (and, the electric car does not consume much energy during cooling, so the cruising range can also be maximized!). Your car can get burned if it sits in the sun all day, Youll want to turn the A/C on full blast just to endure it. A sunshade windshield cover can also help.
5. Try EV Preconditioning
Try EV Preconditioning
Preconditioning is a popular feature for warming the interior of electric vehicles during cold weather. However, it also helps in summer. If your electric vehicle has a preconditioning function, you can remotely pre-cool the cabin before you get into the vehicle. This not only increases range by regulating electric vehicles to the optimum temperature to prevent overloading all day long but also makes for a more comfortable and sweat-free driving experience.
It also saves time by allowing you to pre-condition your EV before you travel. So you dont waste time blowing your air conditioner or fogging up your windows  a win-win solution! Tesla is one of the most used EVs with this feature. You can even set it up remotely via an app, so you dont have to leave your home!
6. Use fewer applications while driving
Have you ever noticed that when you open multiple applications on your phone, your device gets hot and slows down? EV batteries do the same. The more background processes your electric car runs, the hotter the battery gets.
When driving in hot weather, it is recommended to close some of these external applications if they are not important. Gaming apps, text messaging, and music streaming services running in electric vehicle software are just a few of the features that can be shut down to conserve vehicle battery life.
With these simple tips, you can make the most of your EV during the summer.

We will go over the techniques of how to monetise EV charging stations, as well as how to obtain customers and make use of the most modern technology to remain competitive.
As long as you take the right approach, you can make investing in an EV charging station a lucrative and successful business.
Market Analysis for EV Charging Stations
When figuring out the market for EV charging in your property, the initial move is to research the number of EVs and charging stations in the locale. This includes studying sales data, incentives, and existing infrastructure. Evaluating the prospective rise in the EV market is essential too as technology is continually advancing and the cost of ownership is going down.
After determining the present market, one must consider the kind of charging stations they would like to provide. One must take into account the costs, speed, and features to decide which one will best suit the local market. Finally, one should choose the most suitable pricing and financing options.
Lastly, companies need to plan their installation and maintenance of the charging stations. This involves access to skilled personnel, technology and the right tools.
Calculating the cost of EV charging stations
The pricing model for EV charging stations should consider key factors such as the cost of the charging station, the cost of electricity, and the potential income from customers. There are three main pricing models available, including pay-per-charge, subscription-based, and time-based, each of which has its pros and cons. Customize the chosen pricing model to the particular needs of the local market.
An EV Charging Station Loyalty Program
While designing a loyalty program, it is essential to think about what incentives would be most attractive to your customers. This could involve providing discounted rates on charging fees, exclusive discounts on accessories, or even distributing free products. We must also consider rewards that are convenient to redeem, such as digital coupons or points redeemable on the web.
Furthermore, it is essential to evaluate the success of your loyalty program. By monitoring the number of regular customers, you can gain insight into how successful your loyalty program is. Furthermore, customer feedback can help you comprehend how happy customers are with your loyalty program and how it can be improved.

First-time Electric Vehicle (EV) Buyers Guide
Recently, you have probably seen an increase in the number of electric vehicles (EVs) on the road.
If you are ready to become a member of this growing group of EV owners, you may have some queries before making the purchase. What type of EV should I purchase? What should I consider when searching for an EV? Is there anything else I should be aware of? What are the costs associated with driving an EV?
Let us go through the steps to choose the best EV for you.
What kinds of EVs are available?
Right now, there are 3 main types of EVs that you can choose from on the market. They are:

Electric vehicle: How Much Does it Cost to Charge?
Owning an Electric Vehicle (EV) is an exciting step towards a greener world. Utility companies and private enterprises are rushing to provide charging stations and affordable electric cars to keep up with the growing demand. But how much does it cost to charge an Electric Vehicle?
To help you budget your monthly charging costs, weve broken down the figures so you know what to expect.
As the name implies, an electric vehicle (EV) is one that operates on electricity instead of fossil fuels like in a traditional car. The benefits of driving a car that runs solely on electricity are many.
The cost to charge an electric car can vary depending on several factors including where you live, whether you own your charging station, and how many miles your car gets per charge (e.g., city or highway). Many variables affect the final cost, but we can give you a ballpark estimate as well as insights into some ways you can reduce the cost of recharging your EV.
Lets take a look.
Most Electric Vehicle (EV) owners are concerned about the high initial costs and usually forget about the long-term savings that come from charging their car at home or the workplace.
Did you know: In typical circumstances, it costs 7x less to drive an EV for a month as compared to a traditional car
How much does it cost to charge an Electric Vehicle (EV) ?
How much does it cost to charge an Electric Vehicle
?
The best way to calculate this on your own is by dividing your electric bill by the total number of Kilowatts used per hour (kWh). Then take how many kWh your vehicle runs on and multiply that by how much you typically pay in electricity per hour.
Another way to consider how much you will likely pay to charge your EV is by breaking it down by the mathematical statement: The electricity cost per day is equal to the energy consumption, E, in kWh per day multiplied by the energy cost of 1 kWh in AED per kWh.
Cost(AED/day) = E(kWh/day)  Cost(AED/kWh)
Where do you live?
The cost to charge an Electric Vehicle (EV) at home is typically lower than at work, as the cost of electricity is much lower here. If you charge at home, you also have to factor in the cost of buying and installing a home charging unit.
While some EVs come with an onboard charger with a cable, most people prefer to have a dedicated home charger so that their car can charge at a much higher speed and is also much safer.
How many km will your Electric Vehicle get per charge?
The amount of electricity you use per km depends on the type of EV youre charging with. For example, if youre charging your EV with a Level 1 or Level 2 charging station (typically around 8 hours to 80%), the cost per kWh is around 0.38 AED.
If you want to charge your EV at a public charging station, youll have to pay a fixed fee per kWh set by the Utility provider (DEWA, FEWA, ADDC, AADC, etc.) for the electricity you use. Typically, this fee corresponds to around 6.7 AED/hr for AC chargers, depending on the station. If you charge at a DC Fast charger, the cost is usually around 46 AED/Hr at a 150kW unit.
How much electricity is available where you live to charge an Electric Vehicle?
The UAE Power Market is segmented by Power Generation (Natural Gas, Nuclear, and Renewables), and Transmission and Distribution. In areas that have warm summers and cold winters, renewable energy such as solar, wind, and geothermal power is getting cheaper and more accessible.
Electric Vehicle Chargers at Work and Home
Chargers at Work and Home
When you charge your EV at home, you can often choose from a few different types of charging stations depending on your homes wiring and available capacity. If you charge at work, most workplaces may have shared charging stations.
Bottom Line
How much charging your EV costs you have various factors. If you want to charge at home or work you can expect to pay 0.38 AED per kWh. If youd like to charge your EV at public charging stations, youll have to pay a fixed fee per kWh as per the tariff set by the Network. If you live in a premium property, the cost of charging can be higher as there will be a premium charged on the parking. As of today, the tariff is regulated by the utility providers in the country and we shall see how the policy moves over the coming months.

Introduction
Welcome to a cleaner, greener future! As the world races towards sustainable energy solutions, electric vehicles (EVs) have emerged as a powerful catalyst for positive change.
The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is embracing this transformative technology, and at Regeny, we are proud to be at the forefront of the EV charger manufacturing and installation movement.
Today, we delve into the heart of why installing EV chargers is not only essential for the growth of smart cities and governments.
But also a significant step towards environmental preservation and energy efficiency.
1. Paving the Way for Smart Cities:
Picture this: A bustling city where EVs hum quietly along clean streets, reducing noise pollution, and emitting zero tailpipe emissions.
EVs are a pivotal component of smart city planning, offering a seamless integration of transportation and technology.
By installing a comprehensive network of EV chargers throughout smart cities, we unlock a world of possibilities. These chargers ensure that citizens can conveniently charge their electric vehicles at strategic locations, promoting sustainable mobility while reducing reliance on fossil fuels.
2. Electric Fuelling Sustainable Urban Mobility:
Smart governments understand that sustainable urban mobility is the key to a prosperous future. Encouraging the adoption of electric vehicles goes beyond merely offering green alternatives; it lays the groundwork for a cleaner, healthier, and more efficient urban landscape.
When governments prioritize the installation of EV chargers, they demonstrate a commitment to combatting air pollution, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and fostering a more sustainable environment for generations to come.
3. Stimulating Economic Growth:
Beyond its environmental benefits, embracing EV charger installation stimulates economic growth in multiple ways. The burgeoning electric vehicle market opens up new job opportunities, driving innovation in manufacturing, technology, and infrastructure development.
Smart cities investing in EV chargers attract forward-thinking businesses and individuals, leading to increased real estate value, tourism, and local spending.
Its a win-win situation that fosters a thriving economy while supporting a cleaner, healthier planet.
4. Empowering Individuals with Energy Independence:
Imagine never worrying about fluctuating fuel prices or being tied to the limitations of traditional gas stations. EV charger installation empowers individuals with energy independence, granting them the freedom to charge their vehicles at their convenience, be it at home, work, or public charging stations.
The ability to charge an electric vehicle at home not only simplifies daily life but also encourages more people to adopt EVs, knowing that they have a reliable and accessible charging solution wherever they go.
5. Leading by an Electric Example:
Governments play a vital role in leading by example. By integrating electric vehicles into their official fleets and encouraging public sector organizations to adopt EVs, they send a powerful message of commitment to sustainability and environmental stewardship.
When citizens witness their leaders actively supporting EV adoption, it inspires confidence and trust in the transition to a clean energy future.
In conclusion
As the UAE embraces the vision of smart cities and governments, the importance of installing EV chargers cannot be overstated.
Regeny takes immense pride in contributing to this transformative movement, providing cutting-edge EV charger solutions that lay the foundation for a cleaner, more sustainable future.
Together, let us drive towards a world where smart cities thrive, governments lead by example, and individuals enjoy the benefits of energy independence and a greener planet.

This can save time and hassle, especially for those with busy schedules or longer commutes.

This can result in significant cost savings over time, especially for those who drive frequently or for longer distances.
4. Future-Proofing
Future-Proofing
Installing an EV charger in a residential community can help future-proof the property and keep it competitive in the real estate market. By offering EV charging as an amenity, property owners can attract and retain tenants who are looking for a more sustainable and cost-effective lifestyle.

Renting vs. Buying an Electric Car
Renting vs buying an EV. Lets have a closer look. As the world continues to shift towards sustainable energy, electric vehicles have become an increasingly popular choice for environmentally conscious drivers.
However, with the high cost of purchasing an electric vehicle, many are left wondering whether its better to buy or rent. While buying offers the long-term benefits of ownership and potential savings, leasing provides a more affordable and flexible option with the ability to upgrade to newer models.
Its a dilemma that many are facing when it comes to electric vehicles, and the decision ultimately depends on individual circumstances and priorities.
In this blog, well explore the factors to consider when deciding whether to buy or rent an electric vehicle, so you can make an informed decision that suits your needs and budget.
Lets understand the difference between buying & renting an EV
Deciding between leasing or buying your next vehicle is a straightforward process.
If you prefer changing your car frequently and dont mind the limitations on mileage, leasing can be a great option. On the other hand, if you value the independence of owning a car, purchasing is the best choice.
Things to consider before making a decision- buying or renting an EV
Your Lifestyle
Before making a decision, ask yourself why are you specifically considering an EV. You need to keep in mind if youre going to travel short distances or long distances.
If youre just looking for a more sustainable option for a vehicle or just want to get a hang of the driving experience then renting is a more viable option for you. But if youre looking for a long-term noise-free driving experience, govt subsidies or simple before electricity is relatively cheaper than fuel then buying an EV is the way to go.
Your Finances
Before you come to a decision, check your financial situation and list which option is more viable for you in the longer run.
If you have enough savings to pay for a relatively large down payment, you can save a lot on your monthly payments and your future self will appreciate buying an electric car.
However, if you have a long-term savings plan but dont want to pay high upfront costs or high monthly payments, leasing may be the best option for you. Maintain your current lifestyle and savings while having access to a vehicle you can trust.

Your Mindset
Buying an EV right now is a little expensive option but post-purchase benefits are numerous. Its more sustainable, no fuel is required so you save money on gas. It is environmentally friendly as they do not emit pollutants. The maintenance is low due to an efficient electric motor and of course, the performance is better. But all these options have long term commitment.
If youre an automobile enthusiast whod want to get the latest model of car with each passing year, renting is the best option for you.
Currently, purchasing an electric vehicle comes at a significant cost, which also results in a higher cost for car insurance. However, opting for short-term rental of an EV can be a viable option for those interested in testing it out for an extended period. Renting a car could also be a practical choice for those who anticipate minimal driving in their personal vehicle.

6 Essential Tips for Hot Weather EV Driving
With the summer months upon us, electric vehicle (EV) owners may be wondering how to keep their cars running smoothly in the heat. Whether youre a seasoned EV owner or a newbie, its crucial to know how to maintain your vehicle properly during the summer months.
So, buckle up and get ready to learn how to keep your EV running like a dream this summer!
1. Use the ECO mode
Most modern electric vehicles have an eco mode. In addition to saving mileage, this feature reduces the energy used for other functions that consume charge behind the scenes such as air conditioner. The sophisticated feature also improves acceleration, dampens throttle response, and saves valuable battery power.
2. Only charge to 80% capacity
Only charge to 80% capacity
Industry experts say charging between 20% and 80% is the norm for keeping the battery in good shape, especially at high temperatures. Just like your cell phone, the battery gets hotter the longer you charge it. Combined with the sunny weather, this can lead to battery dissatisfaction (not to mention the increased risk of premature battery degradation).
3. Do not charge your EV immediately after driving
Do not charge your EV immediately after driving
Electric vehicle batteries are hot from previous rides, so it is not recommended to charge them too soon (especially if the charger has been exposed to direct sunlight). The best time to charge an EV is at night or early in the morning when temperatures are cooler. In addition, the charging fee is cheaper because it is not charged during the busy season!
4. Shadow is EVs best friend
Shadow is EVs best friend
The easiest and most obvious (and perhaps the most important tip!) is to avoid parking in direct sunlight. Park in a shaded area instead. Unless your electric car is left in the sun for long periods of time (and legally parked!), whether its under a tree, garage, or anywhere else, it helps protect the battery from overheating (and, the electric car does not consume much energy during cooling, so the cruising range can also be maximized!). Your car can get burned if it sits in the sun all day, Youll want to turn the A/C on full blast just to endure it. A sunshade windshield cover can also help.
5. Try EV Preconditioning
Try EV Preconditioning
Preconditioning is a popular feature for warming the interior of electric vehicles during cold weather. However, it also helps in summer. If your electric vehicle has a preconditioning function, you can remotely pre-cool the cabin before you get into the vehicle. This not only increases range by regulating electric vehicles to the optimum temperature to prevent overloading all day long but also makes for a more comfortable and sweat-free driving experience.
It also saves time by allowing you to pre-condition your EV before you travel. So you dont waste time blowing your air conditioner or fogging up your windows  a win-win solution! Tesla is one of the most used EVs with this feature. You can even set it up remotely via an app, so you dont have to leave your home!
6. Use fewer applications while driving
Have you ever noticed that when you open multiple applications on your phone, your device gets hot and slows down? EV batteries do the same. The more background processes your electric car runs, the hotter the battery gets.
When driving in hot weather, it is recommended to close some of these external applications if they are not important. Gaming apps, text messaging, and music streaming services running in electric vehicle software are just a few of the features that can be shut down to conserve vehicle battery life.
With these simple tips, you can make the most of your EV during the summer.

5 Factors That Affect Your EVs Charging Speed
If you power up your electric car, you might observe that you dont always receive the quickest charging rate that your automaker or the charger promised you. On different days, you also might find out that you are getting different charging speeds.
Why does it happen?
The answer is simple. Charging an electric vehicle is more similar to charging your phone than fuelling your vehicle at a gas station.
While every EV is different, here are five factors that affect charging speed:
The State of Charge (SoC) is an indicator of the amount of power left in your battery when you begin to charge it; its equivalent to a fuel gauge.
The State of Charge (SoC)
When your SoC is low, it is much easier for electrons to fill up the seats; in contrast, when your SoC is high, it takes longer for the electrons to find an available spot, thus slowing down the charging process.
Think of it as a movie theatre. When its empty, finding a seat is much simpler than when its full and you have to search for an opening and climb over peoples legs without spilling their popcorn. Similarly, the SoC of a battery affects the speed of the charging.
battery
The temperature of your EV affects recharging speed
The temperature of your EV
Generally, batteries need to be kept at a temperature that is neither too hot nor too cold. This is to protect the battery and maintain its health. An Electric Vehicle (EV) will have a Battery Management System (BMS) that is like the batterys brain, which monitors the batterys safety. Extreme temperatures can affect a batterys life expectancy.
Most EVs come with a thermal management system, which controls the temperature of the battery for it to stay at an optimum level. However, the outside weather can still influence the battery. If it is very hot or the battery has been charging for a long time and is heating up, the charging speed will be slower. Likewise, if it is freezing cold, the charging pace will also be slower.
Using your EV while recharging
If you stay in your car during fast charging, it is important to be aware that some of the energy that should be going to the battery is instead used up by cabin air conditioning, heating, lights, radio, and other accessories. Additionally, the thermal management system also utilizes some of the charging power to regulate the temperature of the battery. This is why it may seem like the kW display on the charger is a bit higher than what the in-dash displays show.
Battery deterioration
Over time, batteries can deteriorate and lose their charging capacity. As a rule of thumb, it is recommended to stop charging when the SoC reaches 80-85%. This not only prevents the battery from becoming too hot but also saves time as the charging rate decreases when the battery is close to being full.
Your vehicles current and voltage limits
Regardless of your EVs charging capacity, it has a max rate of charge it can take in. This maximum charge rate (also known as the voltage limit) is set for the vehicle. For example, if the EV has a maximum charging speed of 7 kW and the charger can give out 22 kW, the EV will still only draw energy at the rate of 7 kW. The opposite is also true, if the EV is able to take 15 kW but the charger can only provide 7 kW, the car will again only draw energy at 7 kW.
Overall, there are many factors that can affect your EV recharging speed, from the type of charger you are using to the temperature of the battery.

Electric vehicle: How Much Does it Cost to Charge?
Owning an Electric Vehicle (EV) is an exciting step towards a greener world. Utility companies and private enterprises are rushing to provide charging stations and affordable electric cars to keep up with the growing demand. But how much does it cost to charge an Electric Vehicle?
To help you budget your monthly charging costs, weve broken down the figures so you know what to expect.
As the name implies, an electric vehicle (EV) is one that operates on electricity instead of fossil fuels like in a traditional car. The benefits of driving a car that runs solely on electricity are many.
The cost to charge an electric car can vary depending on several factors including where you live, whether you own your charging station, and how many miles your car gets per charge (e.g., city or highway). Many variables affect the final cost, but we can give you a ballpark estimate as well as insights into some ways you can reduce the cost of recharging your EV.
Lets take a look.
Most Electric Vehicle (EV) owners are concerned about the high initial costs and usually forget about the long-term savings that come from charging their car at home or the workplace.
Did you know: In typical circumstances, it costs 7x less to drive an EV for a month as compared to a traditional car
How much does it cost to charge an Electric Vehicle (EV) ?
How much does it cost to charge an Electric Vehicle
?
The best way to calculate this on your own is by dividing your electric bill by the total number of Kilowatts used per hour (kWh). Then take how many kWh your vehicle runs on and multiply that by how much you typically pay in electricity per hour.
Another way to consider how much you will likely pay to charge your EV is by breaking it down by the mathematical statement: The electricity cost per day is equal to the energy consumption, E, in kWh per day multiplied by the energy cost of 1 kWh in AED per kWh.
Cost(AED/day) = E(kWh/day)  Cost(AED/kWh)
Where do you live?
The cost to charge an Electric Vehicle (EV) at home is typically lower than at work, as the cost of electricity is much lower here. If you charge at home, you also have to factor in the cost of buying and installing a home charging unit.
While some EVs come with an onboard charger with a cable, most people prefer to have a dedicated home charger so that their car can charge at a much higher speed and is also much safer.
How many km will your Electric Vehicle get per charge?
The amount of electricity you use per km depends on the type of EV youre charging with. For example, if youre charging your EV with a Level 1 or Level 2 charging station (typically around 8 hours to 80%), the cost per kWh is around 0.38 AED.
If you want to charge your EV at a public charging station, youll have to pay a fixed fee per kWh set by the Utility provider (DEWA, FEWA, ADDC, AADC, etc.) for the electricity you use. Typically, this fee corresponds to around 6.7 AED/hr for AC chargers, depending on the station. If you charge at a DC Fast charger, the cost is usually around 46 AED/Hr at a 150kW unit.
How much electricity is available where you live to charge an Electric Vehicle?
The UAE Power Market is segmented by Power Generation (Natural Gas, Nuclear, and Renewables), and Transmission and Distribution. In areas that have warm summers and cold winters, renewable energy such as solar, wind, and geothermal power is getting cheaper and more accessible.
Electric Vehicle Chargers at Work and Home
Chargers at Work and Home
When you charge your EV at home, you can often choose from a few different types of charging stations depending on your homes wiring and available capacity. If you charge at work, most workplaces may have shared charging stations.
Bottom Line
How much charging your EV costs you have various factors. If you want to charge at home or work you can expect to pay 0.38 AED per kWh. If youd like to charge your EV at public charging stations, youll have to pay a fixed fee per kWh as per the tariff set by the Network. If you live in a premium property, the cost of charging can be higher as there will be a premium charged on the parking. As of today, the tariff is regulated by the utility providers in the country and we shall see how the policy moves over the coming months.

EV Charging Stations 101: Which Type Is Right for You?
Electric vehicles (EVs) have been gaining popularity in recent years as people become more environmentally conscious. As a result, there has been an increase in the number of charging stations across the country. However, with so many options available, it can be challenging to know which type of EV charging station is right for you. In this blog, we will explore the different types of EV charging stations and help you determine which one suits your needs.
Level 1 EV Charging Station
Lets start with the basics: Level 1 charging stations. These chargers are the most straightforward and cost-effective option available. They typically use a standard 120-volt outlet, which can be found in most homes and garages. Level 1 charging stations offer a charging rate of around 4 to 5 miles of range per hour, making them perfect for people who dont drive much or have a lot of time to charge.

Which One is Right for You?
Determining which type of charger is right for you depends on your individual needs. If you have a daily commute or use your EV for short trips around town, an AC charging station is likely sufficient. However, if you frequently travel long distances, a DC charging station may be necessary to keep up with your charging
In conclusion
Choosing the right EV charging station can seem overwhelming, but with a little research and consideration, you can find the perfect charging solution for your needs. Remember to take into account your driving habits, the amount of time you have to charge, and your budget before making a decision. Whatever your choice, youll be doing your part to help the environment and reduce your carbon footprint.

6 Essential Tips for Hot Weather EV Driving
With the summer months upon us, electric vehicle (EV) owners may be wondering how to keep their cars running smoothly in the heat. Whether youre a seasoned EV owner or a newbie, its crucial to know how to maintain your vehicle properly during the summer months.
So, buckle up and get ready to learn how to keep your EV running like a dream this summer!
1. Use the ECO mode
Most modern electric vehicles have an eco mode. In addition to saving mileage, this feature reduces the energy used for other functions that consume charge behind the scenes such as air conditioner. The sophisticated feature also improves acceleration, dampens throttle response, and saves valuable battery power.
2. Only charge to 80% capacity
Only charge to 80% capacity
Industry experts say charging between 20% and 80% is the norm for keeping the battery in good shape, especially at high temperatures. Just like your cell phone, the battery gets hotter the longer you charge it. Combined with the sunny weather, this can lead to battery dissatisfaction (not to mention the increased risk of premature battery degradation).
3. Do not charge your EV immediately after driving
Do not charge your EV immediately after driving
Electric vehicle batteries are hot from previous rides, so it is not recommended to charge them too soon (especially if the charger has been exposed to direct sunlight). The best time to charge an EV is at night or early in the morning when temperatures are cooler. In addition, the charging fee is cheaper because it is not charged during the busy season!
4. Shadow is EVs best friend
Shadow is EVs best friend
The easiest and most obvious (and perhaps the most important tip!) is to avoid parking in direct sunlight. Park in a shaded area instead. Unless your electric car is left in the sun for long periods of time (and legally parked!), whether its under a tree, garage, or anywhere else, it helps protect the battery from overheating (and, the electric car does not consume much energy during cooling, so the cruising range can also be maximized!). Your car can get burned if it sits in the sun all day, Youll want to turn the A/C on full blast just to endure it. A sunshade windshield cover can also help.
5. Try EV Preconditioning
Try EV Preconditioning
Preconditioning is a popular feature for warming the interior of electric vehicles during cold weather. However, it also helps in summer. If your electric vehicle has a preconditioning function, you can remotely pre-cool the cabin before you get into the vehicle. This not only increases range by regulating electric vehicles to the optimum temperature to prevent overloading all day long but also makes for a more comfortable and sweat-free driving experience.
It also saves time by allowing you to pre-condition your EV before you travel. So you dont waste time blowing your air conditioner or fogging up your windows  a win-win solution! Tesla is one of the most used EVs with this feature. You can even set it up remotely via an app, so you dont have to leave your home!
6. Use fewer applications while driving
Have you ever noticed that when you open multiple applications on your phone, your device gets hot and slows down? EV batteries do the same. The more background processes your electric car runs, the hotter the battery gets.
When driving in hot weather, it is recommended to close some of these external applications if they are not important. Gaming apps, text messaging, and music streaming services running in electric vehicle software are just a few of the features that can be shut down to conserve vehicle battery life.
With these simple tips, you can make the most of your EV during the summer.

5 Factors That Affect Your EVs Charging Speed
If you power up your electric car, you might observe that you dont always receive the quickest charging rate that your automaker or the charger promised you. On different days, you also might find out that you are getting different charging speeds.
Why does it happen?
The answer is simple. Charging an electric vehicle is more similar to charging your phone than fuelling your vehicle at a gas station.
While every EV is different, here are five factors that affect charging speed:
The State of Charge (SoC) is an indicator of the amount of power left in your battery when you begin to charge it; its equivalent to a fuel gauge.
The State of Charge (SoC)
When your SoC is low, it is much easier for electrons to fill up the seats; in contrast, when your SoC is high, it takes longer for the electrons to find an available spot, thus slowing down the charging process.
Think of it as a movie theatre. When its empty, finding a seat is much simpler than when its full and you have to search for an opening and climb over peoples legs without spilling their popcorn. Similarly, the SoC of a battery affects the speed of the charging.
battery
The temperature of your EV affects recharging speed
The temperature of your EV
Generally, batteries need to be kept at a temperature that is neither too hot nor too cold. This is to protect the battery and maintain its health. An Electric Vehicle (EV) will have a Battery Management System (BMS) that is like the batterys brain, which monitors the batterys safety. Extreme temperatures can affect a batterys life expectancy.
Most EVs come with a thermal management system, which controls the temperature of the battery for it to stay at an optimum level. However, the outside weather can still influence the battery. If it is very hot or the battery has been charging for a long time and is heating up, the charging speed will be slower. Likewise, if it is freezing cold, the charging pace will also be slower.
Using your EV while recharging
If you stay in your car during fast charging, it is important to be aware that some of the energy that should be going to the battery is instead used up by cabin air conditioning, heating, lights, radio, and other accessories. Additionally, the thermal management system also utilizes some of the charging power to regulate the temperature of the battery. This is why it may seem like the kW display on the charger is a bit higher than what the in-dash displays show.
Battery deterioration
Over time, batteries can deteriorate and lose their charging capacity. As a rule of thumb, it is recommended to stop charging when the SoC reaches 80-85%. This not only prevents the battery from becoming too hot but also saves time as the charging rate decreases when the battery is close to being full.
Your vehicles current and voltage limits
Regardless of your EVs charging capacity, it has a max rate of charge it can take in. This maximum charge rate (also known as the voltage limit) is set for the vehicle. For example, if the EV has a maximum charging speed of 7 kW and the charger can give out 22 kW, the EV will still only draw energy at the rate of 7 kW. The opposite is also true, if the EV is able to take 15 kW but the charger can only provide 7 kW, the car will again only draw energy at 7 kW.
Overall, there are many factors that can affect your EV recharging speed, from the type of charger you are using to the temperature of the battery.

First-time Electric Vehicle (EV) Buyers Guide
Recently, you have probably seen an increase in the number of electric vehicles (EVs) on the road.
If you are ready to become a member of this growing group of EV owners, you may have some queries before making the purchase. What type of EV should I purchase? What should I consider when searching for an EV? Is there anything else I should be aware of? What are the costs associated with driving an EV?
Let us go through the steps to choose the best EV for you.
What kinds of EVs are available?
Right now, there are 3 main types of EVs that you can choose from on the market. They are:
1. Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs)
Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs)
Low-emission vehicles that use an electric motor to assist gas-powered engines. Energy comes from regenerative braking and gasoline.
2. Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs)
Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs)
Similar to a Hybrid, but with a larger battery and electric motor. Has a gas tank and a charging port. Can charge by using Level 2 chargers.
3. Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs)
Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs)
Powered solely by an electric battery, with no internal combustion engine. BEVs are the fastest growing of the three and are capable of fast charging and Level 2 charging. Zero emissions.
In choosing an EV, consider the vehicles type and choose the best suited for you.
Consider how you will use your EV
Before deciding to purchase an EV, you should think through the purpose it will serve. If you plan to only go to work or take short trips around your neighborhood, a vehicle with a smaller battery may be enough.
However, if you are going to drive long distances or make frequent trips, it would be beneficial to consider investing in an EV with a larger battery pack and range.
Assess the environmental friendliness of your EV
In terms of size and impact on the environment, each electric vehicle on the market is different.
The variety of electric vehicles available varies in size and respective environmental effects. If you aim to be eco-friendly, it is important to seek out a vehicle that will help you achieve that goal. You can use websites, such as the dubai ev hub , to help you find the EVs available for sale in UAE.
dubai ev hub
Compare costs of various EV models
Compare costs
To make sure you are able to save money, it is wise to look into any local incentives for getting an electric vehicle and figure out how much you may save annually. Compare that to the amount that you usually spend on your current vehicle  you may find that these incentives and the lower cost of driving EVs are sufficient to persuade you to change over!
Know how much time you have before every trip
Additionally, it could also be beneficial to analyze the cost of energy for either an all-electric vehicle or a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle. Occasionally, there are even complimentary public charging stations accessible that can reduce energy costs, which further encourages you to purchase an electric vehicle.
When you own an electric vehicle, you must be mindful of how much time you plan to spend on the road. You need to keep in mind the charging time for your EV. The duration of the charge is contingent on the type of EV charger that you use, as they all have different voltages. Choose DC Fast Chargers whenever you are in a hurry.
Three levels of EV charging stations are available, with different charging speeds, so it is important to consider your needs before buying a car.
Scope out potential EV charging points near you
You must map out all the available charging stations near you with an EV charging station finder like Regeny and take into account how many stations are around you. The Regeny App helps you find the most suitable EV chargers near you across the country.

5 Factors That Affect Your EVs Charging Speed
If you power up your electric car, you might observe that you dont always receive the quickest charging rate that your automaker or the charger promised you. On different days, you also might find out that you are getting different charging speeds.
Why does it happen?
The answer is simple. Charging an electric vehicle is more similar to charging your phone than fuelling your vehicle at a gas station.
While every EV is different, here are five factors that affect charging speed:
The State of Charge (SoC) is an indicator of the amount of power left in your battery when you begin to charge it; its equivalent to a fuel gauge.
The State of Charge (SoC)
When your SoC is low, it is much easier for electrons to fill up the seats; in contrast, when your SoC is high, it takes longer for the electrons to find an available spot, thus slowing down the charging process.
Think of it as a movie theatre. When its empty, finding a seat is much simpler than when its full and you have to search for an opening and climb over peoples legs without spilling their popcorn. Similarly, the SoC of a battery affects the speed of the charging.
battery
The temperature of your EV affects recharging speed
The temperature of your EV
Generally, batteries need to be kept at a temperature that is neither too hot nor too cold. This is to protect the battery and maintain its health. An Electric Vehicle (EV) will have a Battery Management System (BMS) that is like the batterys brain, which monitors the batterys safety. Extreme temperatures can affect a batterys life expectancy.
Most EVs come with a thermal management system, which controls the temperature of the battery for it to stay at an optimum level. However, the outside weather can still influence the battery. If it is very hot or the battery has been charging for a long time and is heating up, the charging speed will be slower. Likewise, if it is freezing cold, the charging pace will also be slower.
Using your EV while recharging
If you stay in your car during fast charging, it is important to be aware that some of the energy that should be going to the battery is instead used up by cabin air conditioning, heating, lights, radio, and other accessories. Additionally, the thermal management system also utilizes some of the charging power to regulate the temperature of the battery. This is why it may seem like the kW display on the charger is a bit higher than what the in-dash displays show.
Battery deterioration
Over time, batteries can deteriorate and lose their charging capacity. As a rule of thumb, it is recommended to stop charging when the SoC reaches 80-85%. This not only prevents the battery from becoming too hot but also saves time as the charging rate decreases when the battery is close to being full.
Your vehicles current and voltage limits
Regardless of your EVs charging capacity, it has a max rate of charge it can take in. This maximum charge rate (also known as the voltage limit) is set for the vehicle. For example, if the EV has a maximum charging speed of 7 kW and the charger can give out 22 kW, the EV will still only draw energy at the rate of 7 kW. The opposite is also true, if the EV is able to take 15 kW but the charger can only provide 7 kW, the car will again only draw energy at 7 kW.
Overall, there are many factors that can affect your EV recharging speed, from the type of charger you are using to the temperature of the battery.

With advancements in battery technology, the cost of producing EVs has come down significantly over the past few years. As a result, EVs are becoming more affordable for consumers, and were seeing a surge in demand for these vehicles. In fact, many experts predict that by 2023, the cost of owning an EV will be on par with that of a traditional gasoline-powered vehicle.
Another factor driving the EV boom is government policies and incentives. The UAE government is to install 3,000+ public charging stations by 2023 with significant investments in EV charging infrastructure. Additionally, the government has introduced a range of incentives to encourage consumers to switch to EVs, including tax breaks and free parking.
The rise of ride-hailing services is also playing a role in the EV boom. Companies like Uber and Careem have pledged to make their fleets fully electric by 2030, which is driving demand for EVs in the commercial sector. This, in turn, is putting pressure on automakers to increase production of EVs to meet demand.
So, what does all of this mean for the UAE?
Well, for starters, it means that the country is well-positioned to become a leader in the global EV market. The UAE charges ahead to an electrified future with ambitious EV infra and incentives, nurturing a sustainable ecosystem. This, in turn, is attracting investors and startups to the region, which could lead to the creation of new jobs and economic growth.
Furthermore, the EV boom is good news for the environment. EVs can significantly cut UAEs carbon footprint and support sustainability goals via emissions reduction.
boom
2023 is shaping up to be a pivotal year for the EV industry. With falling battery costs, government policies, and the rise of ride-hailing services all driving demand for these vehicles, the stage is set for a surge in EV sales. For the UAE, this presents an opportunity to become a leader in the global EV market and make significant progress toward its sustainability goals.

Renting vs. Buying an Electric Car
Renting vs buying an EV. Lets have a closer look. As the world continues to shift towards sustainable energy, electric vehicles have become an increasingly popular choice for environmentally conscious drivers.
However, with the high cost of purchasing an electric vehicle, many are left wondering whether its better to buy or rent. While buying offers the long-term benefits of ownership and potential savings, leasing provides a more affordable and flexible option with the ability to upgrade to newer models.
Its a dilemma that many are facing when it comes to electric vehicles, and the decision ultimately depends on individual circumstances and priorities.
In this blog, well explore the factors to consider when deciding whether to buy or rent an electric vehicle, so you can make an informed decision that suits your needs and budget.
Lets understand the difference between buying & renting an EV
Deciding between leasing or buying your next vehicle is a straightforward process.
If you prefer changing your car frequently and dont mind the limitations on mileage, leasing can be a great option. On the other hand, if you value the independence of owning a car, purchasing is the best choice.
Things to consider before making a decision- buying or renting an EV
Your Lifestyle
Before making a decision, ask yourself why are you specifically considering an EV. You need to keep in mind if youre going to travel short distances or long distances.
If youre just looking for a more sustainable option for a vehicle or just want to get a hang of the driving experience then renting is a more viable option for you. But if youre looking for a long-term noise-free driving experience, govt subsidies or simple before electricity is relatively cheaper than fuel then buying an EV is the way to go.
Your Finances
Before you come to a decision, check your financial situation and list which option is more viable for you in the longer run.
If you have enough savings to pay for a relatively large down payment, you can save a lot on your monthly payments and your future self will appreciate buying an electric car.
However, if you have a long-term savings plan but dont want to pay high upfront costs or high monthly payments, leasing may be the best option for you. Maintain your current lifestyle and savings while having access to a vehicle you can trust.
vehicle
Your Mindset
Buying an EV right now is a little expensive option but post-purchase benefits are numerous. Its more sustainable, no fuel is required so you save money on gas. It is environmentally friendly as they do not emit pollutants. The maintenance is low due to an efficient electric motor and of course, the performance is better. But all these options have long term commitment.
If youre an automobile enthusiast whod want to get the latest model of car with each passing year, renting is the best option for you.
Currently, purchasing an electric vehicle comes at a significant cost, which also results in a higher cost for car insurance. However, opting for short-term rental of an EV can be a viable option for those interested in testing it out for an extended period. Renting a car could also be a practical choice for those who anticipate minimal driving in their personal vehicle.

6 Essential Tips for Hot Weather EV Driving
With the summer months upon us, electric vehicle (EV) owners may be wondering how to keep their cars running smoothly in the heat. Whether youre a seasoned EV owner or a newbie, its crucial to know how to maintain your vehicle properly during the summer months.
So, buckle up and get ready to learn how to keep your EV running like a dream this summer!
1. Use the ECO mode
Most modern electric vehicles have an eco mode. In addition to saving mileage, this feature reduces the energy used for other functions that consume charge behind the scenes such as air conditioner. The sophisticated feature also improves acceleration, dampens throttle response, and saves valuable battery power.
2. Only charge to 80% capacity
Only charge to 80% capacity
Industry experts say charging between 20% and 80% is the norm for keeping the battery in good shape, especially at high temperatures. Just like your cell phone, the battery gets hotter the longer you charge it. Combined with the sunny weather, this can lead to battery dissatisfaction (not to mention the increased risk of premature battery degradation).
3. Do not charge your EV immediately after driving
Do not charge your EV immediately after driving
Electric vehicle batteries are hot from previous rides, so it is not recommended to charge them too soon (especially if the charger has been exposed to direct sunlight). The best time to charge an EV is at night or early in the morning when temperatures are cooler. In addition, the charging fee is cheaper because it is not charged during the busy season!
4. Shadow is EVs best friend
Shadow is EVs best friend
The easiest and most obvious (and perhaps the most important tip!) is to avoid parking in direct sunlight. Park in a shaded area instead. Unless your electric car is left in the sun for long periods of time (and legally parked!), whether its under a tree, garage, or anywhere else, it helps protect the battery from overheating (and, the electric car does not consume much energy during cooling, so the cruising range can also be maximized!). Your car can get burned if it sits in the sun all day, Youll want to turn the A/C on full blast just to endure it. A sunshade windshield cover can also help.
5. Try EV Preconditioning
Try EV Preconditioning
Preconditioning is a popular feature for warming the interior of electric vehicles during cold weather. However, it also helps in summer. If your electric vehicle has a preconditioning function, you can remotely pre-cool the cabin before you get into the vehicle. This not only increases range by regulating electric vehicles to the optimum temperature to prevent overloading all day long but also makes for a more comfortable and sweat-free driving experience.
It also saves time by allowing you to pre-condition your EV before you travel. So you dont waste time blowing your air conditioner or fogging up your windows  a win-win solution! Tesla is one of the most used EVs with this feature. You can even set it up remotely via an app, so you dont have to leave your home!
6. Use fewer applications while driving
Have you ever noticed that when you open multiple applications on your phone, your device gets hot and slows down? EV batteries do the same. The more background processes your electric car runs, the hotter the battery gets.
When driving in hot weather, it is recommended to close some of these external applications if they are not important. Gaming apps, text messaging, and music streaming services running in electric vehicle software are just a few of the features that can be shut down to conserve vehicle battery life.
With these simple tips, you can make the most of your EV during the summer.

Right now, there are 3 main types of EVs that you can choose from on the market. They are:
1. Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs)
Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs)
Low-emission vehicles that use an electric motor to assist gas-powered engines. Energy comes from regenerative braking and gasoline.
2. Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs)
Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs)
Similar to a Hybrid, but with a larger battery and electric motor. Has a gas tank and a charging port. Can charge by using Level 2 chargers.
3. Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs)
Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs)
Powered solely by an electric battery, with no internal combustion engine. BEVs are the fastest growing of the three and are capable of fast charging and Level 2 charging. Zero emissions.
In choosing an EV, consider the vehicles type and choose the best suited for you.
Consider how you will use your EV
Before deciding to purchase an EV, you should think through the purpose it will serve. If you plan to only go to work or take short trips around your neighborhood, a vehicle with a smaller battery may be enough.
However, if you are going to drive long distances or make frequent trips, it would be beneficial to consider investing in an EV with a larger battery pack and range.
Assess the environmental friendliness of your EV
In terms of size and impact on the environment, each electric vehicle on the market is different.
The variety of electric vehicles available varies in size and respective environmental effects. If you aim to be eco-friendly, it is important to seek out a vehicle that will help you achieve that goal. You can use websites, such as the dubai ev hub , to help you find the EVs available for sale in UAE.

Compare costs of various EV models
Compare costs
To make sure you are able to save money, it is wise to look into any local incentives for getting an electric vehicle and figure out how much you may save annually. Compare that to the amount that you usually spend on your current vehicle  you may find that these incentives and the lower cost of driving EVs are sufficient to persuade you to change over!
Know how much time you have before every trip
Additionally, it could also be beneficial to analyze the cost of energy for either an all-electric vehicle or a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle. Occasionally, there are even complimentary public charging stations accessible that can reduce energy costs, which further encourages you to purchase an electric vehicle.
When you own an electric vehicle, you must be mindful of how much time you plan to spend on the road. You need to keep in mind the charging time for your EV. The duration of the charge is contingent on the type of EV charger that you use, as they all have different voltages. Choose DC Fast Chargers whenever you are in a hurry.
Three levels of EV charging stations are available, with different charging speeds, so it is important to consider your needs before buying a car.
Scope out potential EV charging points near you
You must map out all the available charging stations near you with an EV charging station finder like Regeny and take into account how many stations are around you. The Regeny App helps you find the most suitable EV chargers near you across the country.

5 Factors That Affect Your EVs Charging Speed
If you power up your electric car, you might observe that you dont always receive the quickest charging rate that your automaker or the charger promised you. On different days, you also might find out that you are getting different charging speeds.
Why does it happen?
The answer is simple. Charging an electric vehicle is more similar to charging your phone than fuelling your vehicle at a gas station.
While every EV is different, here are five factors that affect charging speed:
The State of Charge (SoC) is an indicator of the amount of power left in your battery when you begin to charge it; its equivalent to a fuel gauge.
The State of Charge (SoC)
When your SoC is low, it is much easier for electrons to fill up the seats; in contrast, when your SoC is high, it takes longer for the electrons to find an available spot, thus slowing down the charging process.
Think of it as a movie theatre. When its empty, finding a seat is much simpler than when its full and you have to search for an opening and climb over peoples legs without spilling their popcorn. Similarly, the SoC of a battery affects the speed of the charging.
battery
The temperature of your EV affects recharging speed
The temperature of your EV
Generally, batteries need to be kept at a temperature that is neither too hot nor too cold. This is to protect the battery and maintain its health. An Electric Vehicle (EV) will have a Battery Management System (BMS) that is like the batterys brain, which monitors the batterys safety. Extreme temperatures can affect a batterys life expectancy.
Most EVs come with a thermal management system, which controls the temperature of the battery for it to stay at an optimum level. However, the outside weather can still influence the battery. If it is very hot or the battery has been charging for a long time and is heating up, the charging speed will be slower. Likewise, if it is freezing cold, the charging pace will also be slower.
Using your EV while recharging
If you stay in your car during fast charging, it is important to be aware that some of the energy that should be going to the battery is instead used up by cabin air conditioning, heating, lights, radio, and other accessories. Additionally, the thermal management system also utilizes some of the charging power to regulate the temperature of the battery. This is why it may seem like the kW display on the charger is a bit higher than what the in-dash displays show.
Battery deterioration
Over time, batteries can deteriorate and lose their charging capacity. As a rule of thumb, it is recommended to stop charging when the SoC reaches 80-85%. This not only prevents the battery from becoming too hot but also saves time as the charging rate decreases when the battery is close to being full.
Your vehicles current and voltage limits
Regardless of your EVs charging capacity, it has a max rate of charge it can take in. This maximum charge rate (also known as the voltage limit) is set for the vehicle. For example, if the EV has a maximum charging speed of 7 kW and the charger can give out 22 kW, the EV will still only draw energy at the rate of 7 kW. The opposite is also true, if the EV is able to take 15 kW but the charger can only provide 7 kW, the car will again only draw energy at 7 kW.
Overall, there are many factors that can affect your EV recharging speed, from the type of charger you are using to the temperature of the battery.

Electric vehicle: How Much Does it Cost to Charge?
Owning an Electric Vehicle (EV) is an exciting step towards a greener world. Utility companies and private enterprises are rushing to provide charging stations and affordable electric cars to keep up with the growing demand. But how much does it cost to charge an Electric Vehicle?
To help you budget your monthly charging costs, weve broken down the figures so you know what to expect.
As the name implies, an electric vehicle (EV) is one that operates on electricity instead of fossil fuels like in a traditional car. The benefits of driving a car that runs solely on electricity are many.
The cost to charge an electric car can vary depending on several factors including where you live, whether you own your charging station, and how many miles your car gets per charge (e.g., city or highway). Many variables affect the final cost, but we can give you a ballpark estimate as well as insights into some ways you can reduce the cost of recharging your EV.
Lets take a look.
Most Electric Vehicle (EV) owners are concerned about the high initial costs and usually forget about the long-term savings that come from charging their car at home or the workplace.
Did you know: In typical circumstances, it costs 7x less to drive an EV for a month as compared to a traditional car
How much does it cost to charge an Electric Vehicle (EV) ?
How much does it cost to charge an Electric Vehicle
?
The best way to calculate this on your own is by dividing your electric bill by the total number of Kilowatts used per hour (kWh). Then take how many kWh your vehicle runs on and multiply that by how much you typically pay in electricity per hour.
Another way to consider how much you will likely pay to charge your EV is by breaking it down by the mathematical statement: The electricity cost per day is equal to the energy consumption, E, in kWh per day multiplied by the energy cost of 1 kWh in AED per kWh.
Cost(AED/day) = E(kWh/day)  Cost(AED/kWh)
Where do you live?
The cost to charge an Electric Vehicle (EV) at home is typically lower than at work, as the cost of electricity is much lower here. If you charge at home, you also have to factor in the cost of buying and installing a home charging unit.
While some EVs come with an onboard charger with a cable, most people prefer to have a dedicated home charger so that their car can charge at a much higher speed and is also much safer.
How many km will your Electric Vehicle get per charge?
The amount of electricity you use per km depends on the type of EV youre charging with. For example, if youre charging your EV with a Level 1 or Level 2 charging station (typically around 8 hours to 80%), the cost per kWh is around 0.38 AED.
If you want to charge your EV at a public charging station, youll have to pay a fixed fee per kWh set by the Utility provider (DEWA, FEWA, ADDC, AADC, etc.) for the electricity you use. Typically, this fee corresponds to around 6.7 AED/hr for AC chargers, depending on the station. If you charge at a DC Fast charger, the cost is usually around 46 AED/Hr at a 150kW unit.
How much electricity is available where you live to charge an Electric Vehicle?
The UAE Power Market is segmented by Power Generation (Natural Gas, Nuclear, and Renewables), and Transmission and Distribution. In areas that have warm summers and cold winters, renewable energy such as solar, wind, and geothermal power is getting cheaper and more accessible.
Electric Vehicle Chargers at Work and Home
Chargers at Work and Home
When you charge your EV at home, you can often choose from a few different types of charging stations depending on your homes wiring and available capacity. If you charge at work, most workplaces may have shared charging stations.
Bottom Line
How much charging your EV costs you have various factors. If you want to charge at home or work you can expect to pay 0.38 AED per kWh. If youd like to charge your EV at public charging stations, youll have to pay a fixed fee per kWh as per the tariff set by the Network. If you live in a premium property, the cost of charging can be higher as there will be a premium charged on the parking. As of today, the tariff is regulated by the utility providers in the country and we shall see how the policy moves over the coming months.

EV boom in the UAE- 2023 Looks a Whole lot Greener
2023 will be pivotal for the automotive industry due to the impending EV boom. Governments worldwide demand sustainable transportation due to high climate change concerns, including the UAE. In this blog, well take a closer look at why 2023 is set to be the year of the EV boom and what this means for the UAE.
One of the key factors driving the growth of EVs is the falling cost of batteries. With advancements in battery technology, the cost of producing EVs has come down significantly over the past few years. As a result, EVs are becoming more affordable for consumers, and were seeing a surge in demand for these vehicles. In fact, many experts predict that by 2023, the cost of owning an EV will be on par with that of a traditional gasoline-powered vehicle.
Another factor driving the EV boom is government policies and incentives. The UAE government is to install 3,000+ public charging stations by 2023 with significant investments in EV charging infrastructure. Additionally, the government has introduced a range of incentives to encourage consumers to switch to EVs, including tax breaks and free parking.
The rise of ride-hailing services is also playing a role in the EV boom. Companies like Uber and Careem have pledged to make their fleets fully electric by 2030, which is driving demand for EVs in the commercial sector. This, in turn, is putting pressure on automakers to increase production of EVs to meet demand.
So, what does all of this mean for the UAE?
Well, for starters, it means that the country is well-positioned to become a leader in the global EV market. The UAE charges ahead to an electrified future with ambitious EV infra and incentives, nurturing a sustainable ecosystem. This, in turn, is attracting investors and startups to the region, which could lead to the creation of new jobs and economic growth.
Furthermore, the EV boom is good news for the environment. EVs can significantly cut UAEs carbon footprint and support sustainability goals via emissions reduction.

2023 is shaping up to be a pivotal year for the EV industry. With falling battery costs, government policies, and the rise of ride-hailing services all driving demand for these vehicles, the stage is set for a surge in EV sales.

Renting vs. Buying an Electric Car
Renting vs buying an EV. Lets have a closer look. As the world continues to shift towards sustainable energy, electric vehicles have become an increasingly popular choice for environmentally conscious drivers.
However, with the high cost of purchasing an electric vehicle, many are left wondering whether its better to buy or rent. While buying offers the long-term benefits of ownership and potential savings, leasing provides a more affordable and flexible option with the ability to upgrade to newer models.
Its a dilemma that many are facing when it comes to electric vehicles, and the decision ultimately depends on individual circumstances and priorities.
In this blog, well explore the factors to consider when deciding whether to buy or rent an electric vehicle, so you can make an informed decision that suits your needs and budget.
Lets understand the difference between buying & renting an EV
Deciding between leasing or buying your next vehicle is a straightforward process.
If you prefer changing your car frequently and dont mind the limitations on mileage, leasing can be a great option. On the other hand, if you value the independence of owning a car, purchasing is the best choice.
Things to consider before making a decision- buying or renting an EV
Your Lifestyle
Before making a decision, ask yourself why are you specifically considering an EV. You need to keep in mind if youre going to travel short distances or long distances.
If youre just looking for a more sustainable option for a vehicle or just want to get a hang of the driving experience then renting is a more viable option for you. But if youre looking for a long-term noise-free driving experience, govt subsidies or simple before electricity is relatively cheaper than fuel then buying an EV is the way to go.
Your Finances
Before you come to a decision, check your financial situation and list which option is more viable for you in the longer run.
If you have enough savings to pay for a relatively large down payment, you can save a lot on your monthly payments and your future self will appreciate buying an electric car.
However, if you have a long-term savings plan but dont want to pay high upfront costs or high monthly payments, leasing may be the best option for you. Maintain your current lifestyle and savings while having access to a vehicle you can trust.
vehicle
Your Mindset
Buying an EV right now is a little expensive option but post-purchase benefits are numerous. Its more sustainable, no fuel is required so you save money on gas. It is environmentally friendly as they do not emit pollutants. The maintenance is low due to an efficient electric motor and of course, the performance is better. But all these options have long term commitment.
If youre an automobile enthusiast whod want to get the latest model of car with each passing year, renting is the best option for you.
Currently, purchasing an electric vehicle comes at a significant cost, which also results in a higher cost for car insurance. However, opting for short-term rental of an EV can be a viable option for those interested in testing it out for an extended period. Renting a car could also be a practical choice for those who anticipate minimal driving in their personal vehicle.

Driving the Shift toward Sustainable Transportation
The UAEs ambitious vision for a sustainable future has placed a strong emphasis on reducing carbon emissions and promoting environmentally friendly practices. EV charging stations play a crucial role in this effort by providing the necessary infrastructure to support the adoption of electric vehicles. These stations are strategically located across the country, making EV recharging convenient and accessible to both residents and tourists alike.
Accelerating the Adoption of Electric Vehicles
One of the main barriers to widespread EV adoption is range anxiety  the fear of running out of battery power while on the road. The presence of a well-established network of EV charging stations mitigates this concern by assuring drivers that they can easily recharge their vehicles during their journeys. This reassurance encourages more people to make the switch to electric vehicles, leading to a substantial reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution.
Enhancing the Convenience of EV Ownership
EV charging stations are designed to provide a seamless charging experience for EV owners. They offer different types of charging options, including standard and fast charging, catering to the diverse needs of electric vehicle users. Additionally, many charging stations are equipped with advanced technologies that enable drivers to monitor charging progress, pay for services, and access real-time information through user-friendly smartphone applications. This convenience factor further incentivises individuals to embrace electric vehicles as their primary mode of transportation.
Economic Opportunities and Job Creation
The rapid expansion of EV charging infrastructure in the UAE has led to the creation of new economic opportunities. The installation , operation, and maintenance of EV recharging stations have generated jobs in various sectors, including construction, technology, and service industries. Additionally, the growth of the EV charging ecosystem has opened avenues for entrepreneurship and innovation, attracting local and international businesses to invest in this emerging market.

EV Charging Stations 101: Which Type Is Right for You?
Electric vehicles (EVs) have been gaining popularity in recent years as people become more environmentally conscious. As a result, there has been an increase in the number of charging stations across the country. However, with so many options available, it can be challenging to know which type of EV charging station is right for you. In this blog, we will explore the different types of EV charging stations and help you determine which one suits your needs.
Level 1 EV Charging Station
Lets start with the basics: Level 1 charging stations. These chargers are the most straightforward and cost-effective option available. They typically use a standard 120-volt outlet, which can be found in most homes and garages. Level 1 charging stations offer a charging rate of around 4 to 5 miles of range per hour, making them perfect for people who dont drive much or have a lot of time to charge.
AC EV Charging Stations
AC charging stations, also known as Level 2 chargers, are the most common type of charging station youll find. They use an AC power source to charge your EVs battery, and they can be found in both residential and commercial locations. AC chargers are perfect for daily charging needs, as they provide a charging rate of around 25-30 miles per hour. They are also relatively affordable and easy to install, making them an excellent option for most EV owners.
DC EV Charging Stations
DC charging stations, also known as Level 3 or fast chargers, are the most potent and fastest charging option available. They use a direct current (DC) power source to charge your EVs battery and can deliver a whopping 80% charge in as little as 20-30 minutes! However, DC charging stations are much more expensive than AC chargers and require a specialized installation. DC charging stations are ideal for those who need a quick charge on the go, such as long-distance travelers.
Which One is Right for You?
Determining which type of charger is right for you depends on your individual needs. If you have a daily commute or use your EV for short trips around town, an AC charging station is likely sufficient. However, if you frequently travel long distances, a DC charging station may be necessary to keep up with your charging
In conclusion
Choosing the right EV charging station can seem overwhelming, but with a little research and consideration, you can find the perfect charging solution for your needs. Remember to take into account your driving habits, the amount of time you have to charge, and your budget before making a decision. Whatever your choice, youll be doing your part to help the environment and reduce your carbon footprint.

Revolutionising EV Efficiency: The Power of Regenerative Braking
At Regeny, were committed to pioneering sustainable solutions for the future of transportation in the UAE. We understand the vital role that technology plays in creating a more eco-conscious world.
In this blog, we delve into the concept of regenerative brakinga remarkable technology that not only enhances the efficiency of electric vehicles (EVs) but also aligns perfectly with our mission of promoting sustainable driving practices.
our mission
What is Regenerative Braking?
Regenerative braking is a revolutionary technology that sets electric vehicles apart from their internal combustion engine counterparts. Unlike traditional friction-based braking systems, regenerative braking is all about capturing and reusing energy that would otherwise be lost as heat during braking.
How Does Regenerative Braking Work?
At the heart of regenerative braking lies a simple yet ingenious process. When you apply the brakes in an EV equipped with this technology, the electric motor switches rolesit becomes a generator.
As the vehicle slows down, it converts kinetic energy into electrical energy. This electrical energy is then sent to the battery, where its stored for future use, such as powering the vehicle or extending its range.
Benefits of Regenerative Braking
Regenerative braking offers a multitude of benefits. For starters, it significantly reduces energy consumption during driving, resulting in increased efficiency. Moreover, it helps to lower emissions, making EVs an even greener alternative to traditional vehicles.
Additionally, regenerative braking contributes to a smoother and more comfortable driving experience, as it often provides more controlled and predictable deceleration.
Real-World Applications
Youll find regenerative braking in various EVs on the market today. For instance, the Tesla Model 3 and Nissan Leaf both incorporate this technology. Regeny is proud to be at the forefront of installing EV chargers and promoting regenerative braking in the UAE.
Challenges and Considerations
While regenerative braking is a game-changer, its not without its challenges. The efficiency of regenerative braking can decrease at high speeds, and it may not be as effective in stop-and-go city traffic as it is on the open highway.
EV owners should also be aware of maintenance considerations and any potential technical limitations.
The Future of Regenerative Braking
The future looks promising for regenerative braking technology. Ongoing research and development efforts aim to improve its efficiency, making it even more integral to the EV driving experience.
As this technology continues to evolve, it will play a crucial role in reducing our carbon footprint and advancing sustainable transportation.
Regenerative braking is more than just a feature of electric vehiclesits a cornerstone of sustainable driving. It reduces energy consumption, extends the range of EVs, and contributes to a greener future.
At Regeny , were excited about the possibilities that regenerative braking offers, and were here to support your transition to electric mobility.
Revving Up for COP 28: Our Electric Vision for a Greener UAE
As the world gears up for the highly anticipated COP 28 event in Dubai, the focus on sustainability, clean energy, and environmental conservation has never been more crucial.
Against the backdrop of this significant global event, lets delve into how the electric vehicle (EV) revolution, spearheaded by brands like Regeny , is playing a pivotal role in reducing pollution emissions and paving the way for a cleaner, greener future for the UAE.
COP 28 and the Quest for Sustainability
The 28th Conference of the Parties (COP 28) is a momentous event that gathers leaders, experts, and advocates from around the world to discuss and formulate strategies for addressing climate change and its far-reaching consequences.
Hosted in Dubai this year, COP 28 is a unique opportunity for the UAE to showcase its commitment to sustainability and contribute to the global dialogue on climate action.
The Role of Electric Vehicles in Emission Reduction
One of the most pressing challenges discussed at COP 28 is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. While various sectors contribute to emissions, the transportation industry has a significant impact.
This is where the rise of electric vehicles comes into play.
Regeny: Leading the EV Revolution
Regeny, a prominent EV charger manufacturer and installation brand based in Dubai, is at the forefront of the electric vehicle revolution in the UAE.
By providing cutting-edge charging infrastructure and solutions, Regeny is facilitating the widespread adoption of electric vehicles, thereby significantly reducing the carbon footprint of transportation in the region.
Impact on Air Quality and Pollution Reduction  COP 28
Impact on Air Quality and Pollution Reduction
The introduction of electric vehicles has a direct positive impact on air quality and pollution reduction. Unlike conventional internal combustion engine vehicles, EVs produce zero tailpipe emissions.
This means that every EV on the road translates to fewer harmful pollutants being released into the atmosphere, contributing to improved air quality and the health of the population.
Synergy with COP 28 Goals
The objectives of COP 28 align perfectly with the strides being made in the electric vehicle sector. The events emphasis on transitioning to clean energy sources, reducing emissions, and promoting sustainable transportation dovetails seamlessly with the goals that Regeny and the UAE have set for themselves.
Challenges and Future Prospects
While the progress in the electric vehicle industry is commendable, challenges such as charging infrastructure expansion and cost parity with traditional vehicles still need to be addressed.
However, as witnessed with the rise of Regeny and other EV-related initiatives, the commitment to overcoming these challenges is unwavering.
As Dubai prepares to host COP 28, the UAEs commitment to sustainability and environmental stewardship shines brightly. The concurrent rise of electric vehicles, championed by Regeny and other such entities, aligns harmoniously with the events objectives.
By reducing pollution emissions and pushing for a cleaner mode of transportation, the UAE is poised to leave a lasting positive impact not only within its borders but on the global stage as well.
As COP 28 unfolds, let us all draw inspiration from the intersection of this event and the electric vehicle revolution, and collectively work towards a greener future.

2024s Electric Cars: Balancing Power, Price, and Performance
Anish Reddy
Electric Car
As we roll into 2024, its the perfect time to explore the exciting trajectory of the electric vehicle (EV) industry. The previous year laid a robust foundation, but what does the future hold? Lets delve into some educated predictions and trends that are shaping the world of EVs.
The EV Revolution Gains Momentum
The electric vehicle industry is not just growing; its evolving at a pace thats almost electric. 2023 was a landmark year, but 2024 looks set to take this revolution to new heights. This growth is fueled by a global realization of the need for a transformative approach to transportation.
Affordable and Accessible: The New Mantra
A notable trend is the push towards making electric cars more affordable. Brands like MG are leading the charge, offering high-quality, practical vehicles that compete price-wise with traditional fuel cars. The arrival of models like the Dacia Spring is a testament to the industrys commitment to affordability. Big players such as Ford, Nissan, and Renault are also jumping on the bandwagon, slashing prices to make EVs more accessible to the average consumer.
Chinese Brands Zooming Ahead
Chinese car companies are not just participating in the global EV market; theyre setting the pace. Brands like BYD, SAIC, and Geely have made significant inroads, and newcomers like Nio and Chery Automobile are not far behind. Their growth trajectory indicates a more global presence in the near future.
The Middle Eastern Electric Surge
The UAE is making significant strides in electric mobility, ranking eighth globally for EV readiness. The governments initiatives, like Dubais Green Charger, aim for emission-free public transport by 2050. With over a thousand public charging points, EV ownership in the UAE is becoming increasingly convenient.
EV
2024s Most Anticipated EVs
Get ready for an exciting lineup of new models. The Tesla Cybertruck is already making waves in the US and is expected to be a hit in the Middle East. MGs Cyberster Roadster is another one to watch, potentially capturing the EV sports car market with its affordability and fun drive. The Dodge Charger Daytona EV, touted as the first electric muscle car, is also highly anticipated.
Technological Innovations on the Horizon
Advancements in battery technology are a key focus, with efforts to extend ranges and speed up charging times. Solid-state battery technology, a game-changer, might just make its debut in late 2024s. Other innovations include modular battery-swapping technology, a venture by Stellantis and Ample, starting with the Fiat 500e in Madrid.
AI and Digital Privacy: The New Frontiers
AI is set to play a bigger role in EVs, not just in driving but in enhancing the overall user experience. However, with increased digital integration comes the challenge of maintaining digital privacy. Tools like Google Consent Mode are being used by car companies to handle customer data responsibly.
The 2024 s Outlook for EV
The 2024
Outlook for EV
In conclusion, 2024 is shaping up to be a monumental year for the EV industry. With more affordable options, innovative models, and significant market growth, especially in regions like the UAE, the future of electric vehicles is not just promising; its electrifying.
Whether youre a tech aficionado, an automobile enthusiast, or someone keen on eco-friendly transportation, the EV landscape in 2024 has something exciting in store for everyone.

Driving Into the Future: The Economic Revolution of EVs in the UAE
Anish Reddy
Electric Car
EV in Middle East
In the heart of the UAE, a revolution is quietly unfolding. Its not just about the futuristic skyline or the innovative megaprojects; its happening on the roads. The rise of Electric Vehicles (EVs) is more than a nod to environmental consciousnessits a savvy economic strategy for the modern UAE resident.
As we journey through the economic landscape of EV ownership, Regeny emerges as a beacon for cost-effective charging solutions, proving that going electric is not just good for the planet, its great for your finances too.
electric
The Financial Incentives of Going Electric
Lower Operating Costs:
Electric Vehicles are renowned for their efficiency. Without the need for petrol or diesel, the cost to refuel an EV is significantly lower. In the UAE, where distances are vast and commutes are long, this saving becomes even more pronounced. With electricity prices being relatively stable compared to the fluctuating oil market, EV owners enjoy a predictable and lower cost of ownership.
Government Incentives:
Dubai has established a strong foundation to encourage drivers to embrace electric vehicles more rapidly by offering attractive benefits. These benefits encompass exemptions from registration fees, complimentary parking spaces exempt from toll charges, and reduced rates on electricity for charging electric vehicles. Through these substantial perks, Dubai is turning the transition to electric vehicles into a tempting proposition for both individual drivers and companies.
Reduced Maintenance Costs:
An often-overlooked economic benefit of EVs is their low maintenance requirements. With fewer moving parts than a traditional internal combustion engine vehicle, EVs are less likely to need repairs. This translates into lower maintenance costs over the life of the vehicle, adding another layer of savings for the owner.
Regeny: Powering the EV Revolution in the UAE
As the economic benefits of EV ownership become clearer, the next question for many is about infrastructure: Where will I charge my vehicle? This is where Regeny shines, offering an innovative solution to one of the most pressing concerns facing potential EV owners.
Innovative Charging Solutions:
Regeny has recognized the need for accessible, efficient, and cost-effective charging solutions in the UAE. By deploying a network of high-quality charging stations across the country, Regeny ensures that EV owners have reliable access to charging facilities, making the transition to electric driving smoother and more convenient.
Cost-Effective Charging:
Regeny ensures that EV owners can find a charging solution that fits their lifestyle without breaking the bank. This approach not only encourages more drivers to consider EVs but also supports the UAEs vision for a sustainable future.
The Road Ahead: EVs and the UAEs Economic Landscape
The shift towards electric vehicles is a critical component of the UAEs broader economic and environmental strategy. By reducing reliance on fossil fuels, the country is not only safeguarding its environmental legacy but also paving the way for a more sustainable economic future. EVs offer a unique opportunity to merge sustainability with economic benefits, making them an increasingly attractive option for UAE residents.
In conclusion, the economic benefits of switching to Electric Vehicles in the UAE are both vast and compelling. From lower operating and maintenance costs to significant government incentives, the financial case for EVs is strong.
And with Regeny leading the charge in providing cost-effective and convenient charging solutions, the transition to electric mobility has never been easier or more appealing. As we look to the future, the economic advantages of EV ownership, coupled with the environmental benefits, make a convincing case for why the road ahead should be electric.
As the UAE continues to innovate and lead by example, the adoption of EVs is not just about embracing new technologyits about making a smart financial decision that also benefits the planet.
With companies like Regeny at the forefront, the journey towards sustainable mobility is well underway, promising a greener, more prosperous future for all.

Sustainable, Stylish, IONIQ: Hyundais Electric Vision for the Middle East
Introduction
The transition to electric mobility is gaining momentum worldwide, with the Middle East emerging as a key player in this transformative journey. Among the pioneers propelling this shift is Hyundais groundbreaking IONIQ range.
This initiative marks a significant milestone in the regions automotive landscape, aligning with global sustainability goals and the growing consumer demand for electric vehicles (EVs).
At Regeny , we view Hyundais commitment as a catalyst for change, mirroring our own vision of making electric mobility accessible and seamless for everyone.
Overview of Hyundais IONIQ Range
Hyundais foray into the EV market with the Hyundais IONIQ 5 and IONIQ 6 exemplifies innovation and futuristic design. The IONIQ 5, known for its unique angular design and state-of-the-art technology, offers impressive range and fast charging capabilities, setting a new benchmark for electric SUVs.
Meanwhile, the IONIQ 6 follows suit with its sleek, aerodynamic profile and efficiency, pushing the boundaries of what electric sedans can achieve. Both models are equipped with advanced features that enhance the driving experience, including smart navigation systems, eco-friendly materials, and cutting-edge safety features.
These launches not only signify Hyundais commitment to electric mobility but also offer a glimpse into the future of transportation in the Middle East.

Impact on the Middle Easts Mobility
Hyundais IONIQ range launch is not merely an introduction of new vehicles; it represents a significant leap towards sustainable mobility in the Middle East. This region, known for its rich oil reserves and traditionally high dependency on fossil fuels, is witnessing a paradigm shift.
Governments across the Middle East are increasingly investing in green infrastructure, including EV charging stations, to reduce carbon emissions and combat climate change. The IONIQ 5 and IONIQ 6 are poised to meet this growing demand for EVs, offering an attractive combination of performance, reliability, and eco-friendliness that appeals to the environmentally conscious consumer.
Moreover, the introduction of such advanced EVs stimulates the automotive market, encouraging competition and innovation. This is crucial for accelerating the adoption of electric vehicles, as it ensures a broader range of options for consumers and helps dispel common concerns about EV performance and charging infrastructure availability. Hyundais commitment to electric mobility in the Middle East is thus a pivotal moment, signaling a future where electric vehicles are the norm rather than the exception.

Hyundais launch of the IONIQ range in the Middle East contributes significantly to this vision, by increasing the visibility of EVs and encouraging more consumers to consider electric options.
