Multiple reporting channels
Integrity reports can be made to:
- An ABB line manager or another person in the management chain
- A member of the ABB Legal & Integrity team
- A member of the Integrity & Regulatory Affairs team at ABB headquarters in Zurich
- Any local representative designated to handle concerns
- An ABB Human Resources business partner
- The Chief Integrity Officer; or
- The ABB Business Ethics Helpline.
The key is to speak up and report integrity concerns promptly, so that problems can be resolved efficiently and effectively
ABB strives to maintain a culture in which its stakeholders feel comfortable to raise concerns in good faith about potential violations of the law or the ABB Code of Conduct. Good faith reporting means that those making a report reasonably believe that the conduct complained of constitutes (or may constitute) a breach of law, regulations, rules, applicable ABB policies, or the ABB Code of Conduct. To the extent permitted by law and policy and in keeping with the need to conduct a competent internal investigation, we take steps to maintain the confidentiality of the person making a report. Those who choose to identify themselves when filing a report are cautioned that their identity may become known for reasons outside of the control of the investigators. Similarly, the identity of the subject(s) of the investigation will be maintained in confidence with the same limitations.
Reports are received and processed by an independent service provider which forwards the report to a dedicated investigations team within the Legal & Integrity function at ABB headquarters or, in EU countries where required by law, to a local representative of the chosen ABB partner company. All reports are subject to appropriate investigation and are brought to full closure using systematic processes and tracking systems so that due process is followed across our internal investigations.
Help us detect and resolve integrity concerns by promptly reporting concerns you have, and by cooperating with any investigation that follows. For our employees and contractors, refusing to cooperate with an investigation into an integrity concern is a breach of our Code of Conduct.
Retaliation against anyone who in good faith reports a concern to ABB about illegal or unethical conduct is not tolerated. Any employee or contractor who is found to have engaged in retaliatory conduct or the abuse of reporting processes will be subject to disciplinary action.

ABB Supplier Cyber Security
ABB has a duty to ensure that the materials we use do not contribute to environmental degradation. In practice, this means that we have systems in place to monitor and phase out the use of hazardous substances in ABB products and processes, where technically and economically feasible. We have developed lists of prohibited and restricted substances to guide this process and we update them regularly, in line with international regulations.
ABB expects suppliers to actively support ongoing efforts to manage and demonstrate product compliance with regulations such as REACH, RoHS, POPs, TSCA, WEEE, WFD, and the EU Battery directive (see below for further information on these regulations). We require our suppliers and sub-contractors to adopt similar standards and to comply with regulatory requirements.
ABB List of Prohibited and Restricted Substances
The ABB List of Prohibited and Restricted Substances has been compiled in order to help our engineers and suppliers comply with regulatory requirements, ensure a high level of protection for human health and the environment, and manage risks encountered by chemicals present in various products.
The Guide for Suppliers to the ABB List of Prohibited and Restricted Substances is provided with the purpose of supporting the interpretation of the ABB List and providing guidance on supplier’s obligations.
Guide for Suppliers to the ABB List of Prohibited and Restricted Substances
To obtain an older version of the ABB List of Prohibited and Restricted Substances, please contact sustainability.abbzh@ch.abb.com

REACH
The European Union Regulation on Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) entered into force on June 1, 2007. The purpose of this regulation is to ensure high level protection of human health and the environment. This regulation enhances the industry’s responsibility to manage the risks from chemicals and to provide safety information on the substances present in various products. To ensure safe handling, manufacturers and importers are required to gather and disclose information regarding the properties of chemical substances.
Legislation similar to EU REACH has been developed in several countries, like e.g., China and South America countries.
European Commission - REACH
European Chemicals Agency (ECHA)
China REACH – New Chemicals Registration
WFD – Waste Framework Directive (SCIP database)
The Waste Framework Directive sets out measures addressing the adverse impacts of the generation and management of waste on the environment and human health, and for improving efficient use of resources which are crucial for the transition to a circular economy.
As part of the implementation of the EU’s action plan for the circular economy adopted in 2015, the revised Waste Framework Directive entered into force in July 2018. It gave ECHA the task to develop a database with information on articles containing substances of very high concern (SVHCs) on the Candidate List: the SCIP database (Substances of Concern In Products)
The SCIP database has three main objectives:
Decrease the generation of waste containing hazardous substances by supporting the substitution of substances of concern in articles placed on the EU market.
Make information available to further improve waste treatment operations.
Allow authorities to monitor the use of substances of concern in articles and initiate appropriate actions over the whole lifecycle of articles, including at their waste stage.
The SCIP database complements the existing communication and notification obligations for Candidate List substances in articles under REACH.
European Commission – WFD
RoHS
The purpose of the European Union Directive on the Restriction of the use of certain Hazardous Substances in electrical and electronic equipment (RoHS) is to restrict the use of hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment.
Legislation similar to EU RoHS has been developed in several countries, like e.g., China, KSA, South Korea, ...
European Commission – RoHS Directive
China RoHS - EU versus China
POPs
In order to assist developing country Parties and Parties with economies in transition in meeting their obligations under the Stockholm Convention , the POPs-free program was initiated in 2010 to facilitate work on the identification of POPs-free products and the exchange of information on alternatives and substitutes to POPs. The program also seeks to involve industry into the implementation of the Convention and to reduce the use of exemptions.
obligations under the Stockholm Convention
Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) are organic chemical substances, that is, they are carbon-based. They possess a particular combination of physical and chemical properties such that, once released into the environment, they:
remain intact for exceptionally long periods of time (many years);
become widely distributed throughout the environment as a result of natural processes involving soil, water and, most notably, air;
accumulate in the living organisms including humans, and are found at higher concentrations at higher levels in the food chain; and
are toxic to both humans and wildlife
WEEE
The amount of waste electrical and electronic equipment (widely known as WEEE or e-waste) generated every year in the EU is increasing rapidly. It is now one of the fastest growing waste streams. EU rules on WEEE aim to contribute to sustainable production and consumption.
They address environmental and other issues caused by the growing number of discarded electronics in the EU.
European Commission - WEEE Directive
Battery Directive
The Directive on batteries and accumulators, known as the Battery Directive, is the current text in force regarding the manufacture and disposal of batteries in the European Union. Last amended in 2018, it aims at improving the protection, preservation and quality of the environment.
The Directive mainly covers batteries containing hazardous elements such as mercury, cadmium or lead which, when incinerated or landfilled, present a risk to the environment and human health. It sets maximum quantities for certain types of metals and chemicals contained in batteries, and sets targets for waste battery collection rates, as well as financial liability for waste collection and management.
European Commission - Battery Directive
PFAS EU
The PFAS consultation period was planned by the European Commission in September 2023. The commission carries out risk- and socio economic assessments, which are ongoing in 2024. In accordance to the current timeline, first restrictions will become effective in 2027.
ABB participated in the PFAS consultation period, and verified the presence of PFAS in products.
European Commission – PFAS
US CA (California) Proposition 65
Proposition 65, officially known as the Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986, was enacted as a ballot initiative in November 1986. The proposition protects the state's drinking water sources from being contaminated with chemicals known to cause cancer, birth defects or other reproductive harm, and requires businesses to inform Californians about exposures to such chemicals. Proposition 65 requires the state to maintain and update a list of chemicals known to the state to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity
Questions about CA Proposition 65.
US EPA TSCA
The Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) Chemical Substance Inventory contains all existing chemical substances manufactured, processed, or imported in the United States that do not qualify for an exemption or exclusion under TSCA.
This may be your starting place for interaction with EPA on TSCA regulatory matters.
PFAS US EPA TSCA regulation
Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a large class of thousands of synthetic chemicals that are used throughout society. However, they are increasingly detected as environmental pollutants and some are linked to negative effects on human health.

In ABB, we work with SAP Ariba to provide a self-service portal for vendors to manage their company details. The benefits of this approach are to:
Reduce risk of fraud by having only authorized person from the organization to make/update the information
Quick update without dependency from ABB buyers
Vendor is required to log in to SAP Ariba to make the changes.
Access to SAP Ariba to make changes.
If you are an existing supplier to ABB but not yet registered in SAP Ariba, you can continue to inform your ABB contacts about any master data changes. In order to protect you and ABB from fraud, ABB will reach out to you to confirm the validity of this change request.

Purchase Order / ""No PO - No Pay""
ABB has implemented a “ No PO – No Pay” policy, by which vendors are required to provide a purchase order (PO) number on the invoice in order for ABB to accept and process the invoice. As most ABB transactions require a PO, please ensure that you always request a PO from ABB buyers before commencing any work. Whenever a PO is provided, it needs to be clearly indicated on the invoice before submission. We strongly recommend one PO per ONE invoice to ensure timely processing and payment.
No PO – No Pay”
The information on the invoice should match the details defined in the PO, i.e. the PO line item number, PO material number, delivery note number, unit price, quantity (partial or full), currency, etc. If the PO is incorrect/incomplete or have any changes after issuance , request a correction of the PO immediately; otherwise there is a risk of late payment.
or have any changes after issuance
In case invoices are sent to ABB without a PO, ABB reserves the right to return the invoice to the supplier with the reason specified. In this case, the invoice is considered incomplete and must be replaced with a correct invoice.
Submitting Invoices
Our preferred option of receiving an invoice is electronically, where allowed by law (machine-readable PDF via email and an e-invoice/EDI, if available in the ABB country).
- Correct and timely submission of invoices
Correct and timely submission of invoices
The timely submission of invoices with correct invoice information is critical for ABB to process and make the payment on time. Please ensure that all invoices are sent to the correct address.
- Meeting national legal requirements and ABB’s invoice requirement
Meeting national legal requirements and ABB’s invoice requirement
It is important for suppliers to ensure that national legal requirements and ABB’s invoice requirement are met. Any invoice that does not meet the mandatory requirements will not be accepted.
Please click here to see information on invoice address and requirements.
Receipt of Goods/Services
ABB applies a 3-way match concept, by which the purchase order, the goods/service receipt, and the invoice need to be successfully matched before the invoice can be ready for payment. The invoice should only be sent to ABB according to agreed incoterms for goods and services already received by ABB.
for goods and services already received by ABB.
Payment
Payment Terms ABB has a global payment term policy. In general, payment due dates are calculated from the issue date of the invoice. In case invoices are received more than 7 days from the issue date through any official invoice channel, we reserve the right to calculate the due date from the date the invoice was received. As part of a standardization process, ABB has introduced a once-a-month-payment concept: paying all suppliers globally at the same time. As a consequence, all permissible payment terms must follow the end-of-month (EOM) concept, accumulating all invoices throughout the month and then processing them in one batch at the beginning of the next month.
Payment Terms
Payment Run In October 2019, ABB introduced a single payment run per month, globally paying all suppliers on the 4th of each month. ABB wants to ensure that it treats all suppliers equally in terms of payments, so the EOM payment process has been mandatory for all our suppliers since 2019, where legally possible. The payments are made to suppliers on the 4th of every month; in case this date is a local bank holiday or weekend, the payment run will take place on the next available working day.
Payment Run
Updated Vendor Bank Accounts and emails for remittance advice Please always ensure that all information and bank details are up-to-date in ABB records. Any changes such as banking information must get updated as soon as possible in your vendor account in order for the payment process to go smoothly. Remittance advice is automatically sent if an email ID is maintained (preferably a group email account to avoid frequent changes). Please click this link to find out how you can update your company information.

Invoice Options
Our preferred option of receiving an invoice is electronically, where legally allowed (machine-readable PDF via email and e-invoice/EDI, if available in the country).
E-Invoice/EDI solutions
PDF Invoices
Physical invoices
Electronic invoicing (e-invoicing) is the automated generation, exchange, and processing of a structured digital file format which consists of all invoice information.
Receiving invoices via e-invoice/EDI allows ABB to seamlessly process the invoice and pay our vendors on time. The benefits of using e-invoice are:
for suppliers – fewer rejected invoices, quicker payments, reduced costs, higher productivity, better cash management, improved buyer/supplier collaboration, etc.
for ABB – better dispute handling, quicker processing and payment cycles, improved account reconciliation, leveraging early payment discounts, improving AP productivity, eliminating duplicates, etc.
Thus, ABB’s e-invoice program initiative forms a win-win situation with its suppliers by having measurable value outcomes and creating a balance for mutual sustained success.
The e-invoice program is being implemented in phases. Suppliers will be informed as soon as this instrument is available to cover end-to-end processes, from purchase order to invoice.
Machine-readable PDF invoices is our next preferred option if the e-invoice program is not available in a given country.
Similar to e-invoices, a machine-readable PDF invoice is also a digital form of invoice, but without the structured digital file format.
ABB works closely with our external invoice scanning providers to capture vendors’ invoices quickly and accurately, and to transform the information into data files for ABB to process.
Please note that in order to submit an invoice via email and have ABB smoothly receive process it, you are required to follow the email requirements.
The file size of the email should not be more than 10 MB in size
One (1) email is to contain only one (1) invoice as a single PDF File (invoices in Word/Excel will be rejected).
One (1) email
one (1) invoice
Supporting documentation should be in the same PDF as the invoice, with the invoice as the first page . Please note that supporting documents in Word or Excel should not be attached in the same email with the invoice. The entire email will be rejected due to the unacceptable file format.
invoice as the first page
Zipped files or emails attached in other emails are not acceptable.
If you scan a paper invoice, the invoice image must have at least 300 dpi resolution and be black and white.
The file name of the attachment should not contain special symbols or characters, such as #, $, *, @, :, -, &, etc.
Password-protected documents are not accepted.
Please do not include any written message which requires any action in the email, as the message will not be read.
The invoices billed to ABB are to be emailed only once. Do not use the above email addresses in copies of any correspondence or for sending statements of accounts, quotations, etc. All messages will be ignored.
ABB encourages vendors to use digital invoices whenever possible. If vendors are not able to use digital invoices due to the country’s legal requirements, vendors may send their physical invoices to the address shown on ABB’s purchase order or the addresses listed in the Invoice Requirements section.
For more information about invoice addresses and invoice requirements, please click here.
Invoice Requirements
ABB only makes payments against valid original invoices. Please ensure that all legal requirements and ABB invoice requirements are met in order for invoice to be processed. Any invoice that does not meet the requirements will result in a delay of payment or rejection of the invoice.
Please take note of the important note below and click on the bill to country to view the invoice receipt address and complete invoice requirements.
IMPORTANT NOTE:
Before submitting an invoice, please make sure that your invoice is accurate and complete and meets all national legal requirements.

We strongly recommend suppliers to bill ONE (1) Purchase Order per ONE (1) invoice. If you add multiple Pos to one invoice, the invoice processing will take longer and you will only be paid if everything is correct.
Please ensure that the invoice indicates the current, valid PO number and does not state an old PO number, as this makes processing difficult.

ABB has factories in about 100 countries, making products and realizing projects with the help of more than 60,000 materials and service suppliers. Together, ABB and its suppliers have the responsibility to run their business in a sustainable way. This means that each of us is obeying international and local laws, taking action to limit environmental impacts, respecting the legal and human rights of workers, and implementing effective health and safety policies, within both our own operations and the ex-tended supply chain.
The ABB Supplier Code of Conduct (SCoC) clearly outlines our expectations, based on principles con-tained within the International Bill of Human Rights, the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, the ILO Core Conventions on Labor Stand-ards, and all applicable laws and principles in the areas of human rights and decent work. It is updated periodically to address new developments.
We expect our suppliers to respect the same international principles and standards of human rights.
ABB has also implemented the Sustainable Supply Base Management (SSBM) approach to improve the sustainability performance of our suppliers, especially those exposed to sustainability risks.
SSBM addresses sustainability topics and performance at each stage of supplier life cycle manage-ment, as part of our “beyond audit” approach. It covers issues in six main categories: general man-agement, human and labor rights, social benefits, health, safety, and the environment.
As part of our new supplier onboarding process, the supplier is requested to perform a sustainability self-assessment. Depending on the result of this self-assessment and other important parameters, further due diligence may be performed, such as an onsite sustainability assessment.
Once a supplier is part of ABB’s supply base, a risk-based approach is followed for monitoring a sup-plier’s sustainability performance through self-assessments. We also engage with selected suppliers for training, onsite assessments, and follow-up audits until all findings are finalized.
Find out more about the Sustainable Supply Base Management program here.

In partnership with our suppliers, we are committed to using in our products tin, tungsten, tantalum, and gold which has been legally and ethically sourced.
ABB’s efforts to source minerals responsibly are reinforced by the ABB Policy on Conflict Minerals and our continued collaboration with the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI), which works to encourage smelters and refiners to undergo audits aligned with OECD guidelines.
ABB’s engagement doesn’t stop at investigating the sources of tin, tungsten, tantalum, and gold. We continue to support responsible mineral sourcing and industry initiatives. That’s why ABB has initiated the Cobalt Engagement Program for our suppliers and will, over time, include in the program more minerals that pose potential social and environmental risks.
ABB is committed to:
• identifying which ABB products are impacted and targeting our efforts accordingly; • not buying products and materials containing “conflict minerals” directly from conflict mines (from conflict-affected and high-risk areas (CAHRAs) and the covered countries) ; • working with our suppliers to ensure that any conflict minerals contained in the products and materials supplied to ABB originate from conflict-free sources; • contributing to conflict-free trade by encouraging our suppliers not to discriminate against legitimate sources of conflict minerals; and • increasing our impact by continuously evaluating our Responsible Minerals Sourcing program and extend-ing it with additional minerals.
In addition, we are committed to engaging with our customers regarding their disclosure obligations.
Conflict Minerals in the supply chain

Strict legal frameworks have been put in place around the world to regulate the use of tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold: a group of elements that are collectively known as “3TG” or “conflict minerals.” The European Commission has singled out T3 minerals [A1] [A2] (Tin, Tantalum & Tungsten) as those which are most likely to be associated with armed conflict in high-risk countries, such as the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). They are present in welding wire, capacitors, electronic contacts, and the coatings of electrical connections – all of which are used in many of our products.
T3 minerals
The eastern portion of the DRC has long been the site of one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises – and the conflict there continues. Revenue from the illegal mining and trading of the DRC’s natural resources has been exploited to fund armed conflict – to which serious human rights abuses are linked – and to mines for certain ores, now known as conflict minerals.
known as conflict minerals.
Under the Dodd–Frank Act in the United States, the following minerals and their derivatives are defined as conflict minerals (the 3TG):
1. Columbite-tantalite (Coltan), refined into tantalum (Ta) 2. Cassiterite, refined into tin (Sn) 3. Wolframite, refined into tungsten (W) 4. Gold (Au)
Legal frameworks: Dodd-Frank Act, EU Legislation
In August 2012, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued its final rules regarding conflict minerals (tantalum, tin, tungsten, and gold) as defined in and required by section 1502 of the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. As a result, many companies are now investigating whether and to what extent their products contain conflict minerals and whether such conflict minerals come from the DRC and the adjacent countries named in the Act.
For more information on the Dodd–Frank Act Final Rule and Summary, follow the links below:
Dodd-Frank Act – Final Rule
Final Rule Summary
On January 1, 2021, a new law went into force across the EU: the Conflict Minerals Regulation. It aims to help stem the trade in four minerals – tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold – which sometimes finance armed conflict or are mined using forced labor. For further information, please refer the regulation explained in the European Commission Conflict Minerals page .

Measures
In working towards these commitments, we have taken a number of steps:
establishing a “Conflict Minerals Compliance Program,” supported and sponsored by ABB’s Executive Committee, to review the use of conflict minerals and other minerals in our products and to be in a position to fulfill our reporting obligations to the SEC and respond to customer inquiries;
requiring our suppliers to implement a policy regarding conflict minerals and to exercise due diligence in investigating the source of these minerals;
engaging with our suppliers so they respond in a timely manner to our requests for evidence of compliance. In the future, our suppliers’ willingness to comply with this initiative will be a factor in our sourcing decisions; and
updating the ABB Supplier Code of Conduct and our purchasing terms and conditions to reflect this policy
ABB Policy and Supplier Requirements
ABB is committed to ensuring the health, safety, and protection of people who come into contact with our products and business, and we require high social, environmental, and human rights standards among our suppliers. As part of ABB’s commitment and as conveyed in ABB’s Policy on Conflict Minerals, we have established management sys-tems to understand where minerals are sourced, to exclude minerals sourced from conflict zones and to comply with reporting obligations. In order to do so, we have defined a set of requirements for our suppliers. In particular, suppliers are required to:
comply with the ABB Supplier Code of Conduct ;
Take the necessary steps to demonstrate that any conflict minerals contained in the products supplied to ABB originate from conflict-free sources;
extend the search further down their supply chain, if necessary, in order to determine the source of specified minerals;
work towards ensuring that they do not discriminate against legitimate sources of conflict minerals; and
determine and disclose the source of other minerals on request by ABB
Our suppliers’ compliance with these requirements will be a key factor in our future sourcing decisions. All suppliers to ABB will be asked to join efforts to identify whether conflict minerals are used or supplied to ABB and, if so, to identify the country of origin.
To understand ABB’s requirements, suppliers are strongly encouraged to review the following material:

Policy on Health, Safety, Environment, Security and Sustainability
Supplier Code of Conduct
In practice, this means that we have systems in place to monitor the source of certain minerals more closely, and phase out the use of hazardous substances in ABB products and processes. ABB expects suppliers to actively support ongoing efforts to manage and demonstrate product compliance with regulations such as REACH, RoHS and Conflict Minerals. We encourage our suppliers and sub-contractors to adopt similar standards and to comply with regulatory requirements.
Our organization continues to support responsible minerals sourcing and industry initiatives, while working with our suppliers to facilitate conflict-free sourcing that contributes to economic growth. In addition, ABB is a member of the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI) and adheres to the OECD guidelines to increase the transparency of conflict minerals in our supply chain.

The conflict minerals section of the Dodd-Frank Act focuses on supplies of tantalum, tungsten, tin and gold sourced in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and neighboring countries. The purpose of the Act is to reduce violence in the region funded through exploitation of mining and trade activities. Companies listed on the NYSE (SEC registrants) will be required to disclose the use and source of conflict minerals. Companies must make a reasonable determination whether products involve specified materials from the region.

We require our suppliers, contractors and other representatives to follow ABB’s Supplier Code of Conduct or apply a similar set of sustain­ability policies and procedures.

Purchase Order / ""No PO - No Pay""
ABB has implemented a “ No PO – No Pay” policy, by which vendors are required to provide a purchase order (PO) number on the invoice in order for ABB to accept and process the invoice. As most ABB transactions require a PO, please ensure that you always request a PO from ABB buyers before commencing any work. Whenever a PO is provided, it needs to be clearly indicated on the invoice before submission. We strongly recommend one PO per ONE invoice to ensure timely processing and payment.
No PO – No Pay”
The information on the invoice should match the details defined in the PO, i.e. the PO line item number, PO material number, delivery note number, unit price, quantity (partial or full), currency, etc. If the PO is incorrect/incomplete or have any changes after issuance , request a correction of the PO immediately; otherwise there is a risk of late payment.
or have any changes after issuance
In case invoices are sent to ABB without a PO, ABB reserves the right to return the invoice to the supplier with the reason specified. In this case, the invoice is considered incomplete and must be replaced with a correct invoice.
Submitting Invoices
Our preferred option of receiving an invoice is electronically, where allowed by law (machine-readable PDF via email and an e-invoice/EDI, if available in the ABB country).
- Correct and timely submission of invoices
Correct and timely submission of invoices
The timely submission of invoices with correct invoice information is critical for ABB to process and make the payment on time. Please ensure that all invoices are sent to the correct address.
- Meeting national legal requirements and ABB’s invoice requirement
Meeting national legal requirements and ABB’s invoice requirement
It is important for suppliers to ensure that national legal requirements and ABB’s invoice requirement are met. Any invoice that does not meet the mandatory requirements will not be accepted.

Receipt of Goods/Services
ABB applies a 3-way match concept, by which the purchase order, the goods/service receipt, and the invoice need to be successfully matched before the invoice can be ready for payment. The invoice should only be sent to ABB according to agreed incoterms for goods and services already received by ABB.
for goods and services already received by ABB.
Payment
Payment Terms ABB has a global payment term policy. In general, payment due dates are calculated from the issue date of the invoice. In case invoices are received more than 7 days from the issue date through any official invoice channel, we reserve the right to calculate the due date from the date the invoice was received. As part of a standardization process, ABB has introduced a once-a-month-payment concept: paying all suppliers globally at the same time. As a consequence, all permissible payment terms must follow the end-of-month (EOM) concept, accumulating all invoices throughout the month and then processing them in one batch at the beginning of the next month.
Payment Terms
Payment Run In October 2019, ABB introduced a single payment run per month, globally paying all suppliers on the 4th of each month. ABB wants to ensure that it treats all suppliers equally in terms of payments, so the EOM payment process has been mandatory for all our suppliers since 2019, where legally possible. The payments are made to suppliers on the 4th of every month; in case this date is a local bank holiday or weekend, the payment run will take place on the next available working day.
Payment Run
Updated Vendor Bank Accounts and emails for remittance advice Please always ensure that all information and bank details are up-to-date in ABB records. Any changes such as banking information must get updated as soon as possible in your vendor account in order for the payment process to go smoothly. Remittance advice is automatically sent if an email ID is maintained (preferably a group email account to avoid frequent changes). Please click this link to find out how you can update your company information.
