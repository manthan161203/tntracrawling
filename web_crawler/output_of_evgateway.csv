Who Are We?
We are a turn-key Electric Vehicle Infrastructure solutions provider that can deliver station installation, maintenance, network, mobile app and support for all charging scenarios and clients. We currently have thousands of electric vehicle chargers in our network (and we’re still expanding!)
EvGateway is focused on helping to reduce global CO2 emissions by accelerating the adoption and use of Electric Vehicles in cities around the world.
We know that convenient access and ease of use are essential to making drivers feel comfortable in choosing to buy an electric vehicle. That’s why we partner with some of the world’s leading companies to make charging convenient – and productive.
We work closely with vehicle manufacturers and dealers to ensure that when someone drives an electric vehicle off the lot, they have everything they need to get charged up.
But that’s not all! Our extensive experience in launching charging networks across the country along with years working with mobile apps, payment gateways and security allows us to present an easy to use and convenient product.
Our goal is to give our users and clients complete visibility and control to all charging activity!
Our Philosophy
When was the last time you stopped to think before plugging in a lamp or a TV in your house? Probably never. Why? Because it simply works. You don’t think about the complexity of what happens inside the walls or at the transformer box. You plug in and it works.
That simplicity, trust and consistency is what drives us at EvGateway.
We are doing for charging stations networks GPS did for your driving. We gather all the information and provide it all in one place. Our goal is a day in the not so distant future that charging stations are as common ATMs, and make your charging experience simple, easy and fast.

US National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Funding
The National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Funding Program also known as NEVI in short was established after the federal infrastructure investment and jobs act was signed into law. NEVI aims to provide states with adequate capital to set up electric vehicle fast chargers in selected areas.
The National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Funding Program
Why NEVI is important
The setting up of EV chargers in different states is aimed at forming a large network of interconnected EV charging network across the United States. The EvGateway charging station network management includes real-time reports, statistical analysis, 24/7 support, monitoring, remote diagnostics and more. Learn more about it here.
Learn more about it here.
Funding of NEVI is designated to alternative fuel corridors for electric vehicles with the aim of building a national network along the Interstate Highway System. Ten percent of the NEVI funding is set aside annually for the secretary of transportation so as to provide discretionary grants to help fill any gaps within the national network.
A federal guidance sets out the necessary rules
Wyoming is allocated $3.9 million in 2022
NEVI project valuation
California which leads in number of EV chargers installed
According to the California Energy Commission,
NEVI Formula Guide
A NEVI-funded EV charging station solution is exceeded to have a minimum of four 150 kW combined charging system connectors with a total station power of 600kW. EV charging stations are expected to be located 50 miles apart along major roads and highways and at least 1 mile from a freeway exit or highway roadway. Having an electric vehicle infrastructure funding aids EV drivers to have regular access to EV chargers to avoid cases where they may not have access to EV charging stations. In a bid to solve this problem, the charging location map enables you to locate where such chargers are installed. Additionally, EvGateway provides white label solutions such as helping different states and brands to set up more personalized EV network management, price setting, diagnostics, and alerts.
EV charging station
EvGateway provides white label solutions
In conclusion, EV charging stations are meant to be non-proprietary, allow open-access payment methods and be publicly available. EvGateway aims to partner up with major stockholders to ensure the acquisition, ensure the EV infrastructure is well coordinated and set up in various states. Drivers who use the EvGateway application are better equipped to handle the charging of their EVs. Drivers can get to the nearest EV stations as well as receive alerts about their vehicle performance easily. The application also assists EV drivers to get 24/7 support from different endpoints. Nevertheless, the NEVI program provides an opportunity for coordination and collaboration across different state agencies to realize an effective EV infrastructure.
Drivers who use the EvGateway application are better equipped

How to Optimize the Range of your Electric Car
Electric cars are becoming increasingly popular due to their lower emissions and lower running costs compared to traditional gasoline cars. However, one of the biggest concerns for many drivers is the range of an electric car. While the range of an electric car has been improving steadily, it can still be a challenge for some drivers. Fortunately, there are several things you can do to optimize the range of your electric car and get the most out of your battery.
This article also focuses on how EvGateway is suited to offer customizable solutions to the end customer regardless of their requirements and charging needs.
1. Plan Your Route
Planning your route is one of the most important things you can do to optimize the range of your electric car. By carefully planning your route, you can avoid unnecessary detours and hills that could drain your battery faster. There are several online route planners that take into account the range of your electric car and can help you plan the most efficient route.
2. Use Eco Mode
Most electric cars come with an Eco mode, which helps to optimize the range of your electric car. This mode reduces the power output of the motor, limits the use of air conditioning, and adjusts the regenerative braking system to recover more energy. Using Eco mode can extend the range of your electric car by up to 10%.
3. Regenerative Braking
Regenerative braking is a feature that recovers energy when you brake or coast, and uses it to recharge the battery. By using regenerative braking, you can recover some of the energy you would otherwise lose, and extend the range of your electric car. Some electric cars allow you to adjust the regenerative braking to be more or less aggressive, depending on your driving style.
4.Maintain Your Tires
Proper tire maintenance is essential to optimizing the range of your electric car. Under-inflated tires create more resistance, which can reduce the range of your electric car by up to 10%. Make sure to check your tire pressure regularly and keep them properly inflated. According to research, over 25% of all vehicles on the road have improperly inflated tires. Driving an EV with under-inflated tires will increase energy consumption and lead to premature tread wear. As a way of maintenance, always check the air pressure frequently using a simple tire gauge as it varies by an average of one PSI with every 10-degree change in air temperature.
5.Reduce the Load
Reducing the load in your electric car can also help to optimize its range. The more weight your electric car is carrying, the more energy it will require to move. Try to remove any unnecessary items from your car, such as heavy luggage or sports equipment, to reduce the load and extend the range of your electric car.
6.Use Climate Control Sparingly
Climate control is another feature that can drain the battery of your electric car quickly. Using the air conditioning or heating system can reduce the range of your electric car by up to 25%. To optimize the range of your electric car, try to use the climate control sparingly, and open the windows or use a fan instead.
7.Charge Your Battery to the Optimal Level
Charging your battery to the optimal level is essential to optimizing the range of your electric car. Most electric car manufacturers recommend charging your battery to between 80% and 90% of its maximum capacity to extend the battery life. Overcharging or undercharging your battery can reduce its lifespan and decrease its range. By making use of the EvGateway mobile application , drivers can monitor the status of their EVs, start and stop charging and get 24/7 support while in different charging spots.
EvGateway mobile application
8.Use Public Charging Stations Strategically
Using public charging stations strategically can also help to optimize the range of your electric car. Public charging stations are often located in convenient locations, such as shopping centers, restaurants, and tourist attractions. By using these public charging stations strategically, you can extend the range of your electric car and reduce the risk of running out of battery power.
9.Keep Your Battery Cool
Keeping your battery cool is essential to optimizing the range of your electric car. Batteries perform best at moderate temperatures, and extreme temperatures can reduce their performance and lifespan. Try to park your electric car in a shaded area, and avoid exposing it to extreme temperatures.
In conclusion, optimizing the range of your electric car is important to get the most out of your battery and reduce the risk of running out of power. . EvGateway charging station network management includes real-time reports, statistical analysis, 24/7 support, monitoring, remote diagnostics, and more. By planning your route, using Eco mode, regenerative braking, maintaining your tires, reducing the load, using climate control sparingly, charging your battery to the optimal level, using public charging stations strategically, and keeping your battery cool, you can extend the range of your electric car and enjoy a more efficient and eco-friendly driving experience.

Level 2 Charging vs Level 3 Charging – What’s the Difference?
If you own an Electric Vehicle you may have come across the terms level 2 and level 3 chargers when charging your EV. In this article, we explain more on what they mean and what it means for your EV and why you should consider having the EVGateway app
EVGateway app
Charging an Electric Vehicle is quite different from the normal fueling of a car as the recharging process is not as quick as adding fuel to your EV. Well as Forbes explains it , there are numerous reasons that affect charging an EV such as different EVs having different input power, having different connectors and the different levels of charging.
Forbes explains it
Level 2 vs Level 3
The higher the level of charging, the faster the charging process, as more power is delivered to the vehicle. According to Lifewire , a level 2 charger transcends a level 1 charger which offers 120 Volts, while the former offers between 208 Volts and 240 Volts. Level 2 chargers are the most common used chargers and are found in most homes, workplaces and public places. Level 2 Chargers are able to replenish between 12 and 80 miles of range per hour.Level 3 chargers offer 400 Volts and 900 Volts.
According to Lifewire
Level 3 Chargers are superchargers which can recharge an EV at a rate of 3 to 20 miles of range per minute. Due to the high voltage, they are found in public places and not at homes. The Electric Vehicle Charging Network (EVCN) by EvGateway enables you to locate where such chargers are installed. By having the EvGateway mobile application , drivers are able to monitor the status of their EVs and to also get 24/7 support from different endpoints.
EvGateway
the EvGateway mobile application
As level 1 charging stations continue to become few, a number of level 2 and level 3 charging stations are being adopted. According to 365pronto , both level 2 and level 3 chargers are installed in public commercial stations. When considering what charger to install it is best to consider different factors such as your driving habits. EvGateway works with different manufacturers to enhance their chargers into smart chargers thus allowing them to be remotely managed and monitored easily.
According to 365pronto
Advantages of Level 2 Charging stations
Level 2 chargers are faster than the level 1 charger which dispenses 120 V
Level 2 Charger can charge an EV overnight
Ideal for hotels, apartment building
Disadvantages of level 2 charging stations
They need to be installed as they can not plug into a standard 120-volt outline
Level 2 Chargers require a 240-volt outlet.
Takes 5+ hours for full charge, great for overnight charging
Advantages of Level 3 Charging stations
Level 3 Charger charges an EV up to 80% in 30 minutes.
Disadvantages of level 3 Charging stations
Due to the supercharging capabilities, they degrade batteries faster compared to the level 1 and 2 chargers.
They cannot be installed at home due to the high voltage.
In conclusion, level 3 superchargers may be the solution to your charging needs, but it is worthwhile to consider the downsides too. These charging stations will decrease your battery life in the long run and happen to be more expensive too. A Level 2 charger can be the best solution for most EV owners as they can be installed at home or in different public places.However expect longer charge time of up to 8 hours.

Increased Demand for Electric Vehicles
Globally, the rise in fuel prices and a drive to conserve the environment have caused the demand for EVs to increase.Several additional factors have also contributed to the increase in the popularity of Electric Vehicles, including increased government legislation and laws that are geared to boost manufacturing and reduce the cost of Electric Vehicle batteries.
Low percentage of EV charging infrastructure and high costs involved in the manufacture of EVs continue to be large hurdles that need to be overcome. The infrastructure must be installed in major cities, highways, hotels, gas stations, and other appropriate areas to increase the adoption of EVs. The construction of EV charging infrastructure will likely lead to increased manufacture of EVs due to the growing demand. According to Weforum.org , there has been rapid EV penetration which has not matched the much needed public infrastructure to meet the increasing demand in various countries.
Weforum.org
Government Intervention
The rise in demand and popularity of EVs require charging infrastructure to be set up in multiple places such as parking lots, government-allocated locations, and along major highways. According to TechCrunch , the Biden administration has been proactive in its efforts to encourage the adoption of Electric Vehicles. The administration announced a move that will see about 500,000 charging stations installed nationally and additional energy storage which will aid the change to Electric Vehicles.
TechCrunch
There must be a proper balance and management of the increased energy demand on the grid. Enough power lines and storage need to be installed to meet the demand as the EV infrastructure is largely reliant on the grid. It is yet to be established if there are other much suitable options to ensure that the EV charging stations have renewable energy and power generation.
The Benefits of EvGateway
