Al-Futtaim and its associated companies and subsidiaries (Al-Futtaim) would like to alert the public of various fraudulent emails and social media invitations that are being circulated claiming to represent members of Al-Futtaims senior management to solicit illegal business by offering fake loans and financing schemes. Companies and individuals are typically invited to apply for these fake loans and financing schemes which request the individual to pay a percentage of the loan amount as an arrangement fee in advance.
Al-Futtaim would initiate appropriate legal and criminal action against such fraudsters as we deem appropriate in order to minimise these incidents.
We request the public to be wary of any such communication that uses the identity of Al-Futtaim or its officials without authorisation to obtain confidential information or induce financial transactions and investments. Al-Futtaim, its partners and directors accept no liability whatsoever for losses, if any, suffered by anyone who falls victim to such scams from fraudsters.
We urge the public to be vigilant and should they receive such an email or social media invitation, to follow the instructions below:
Please do not respond to the sender or attempt to call any of the numbers mentioned in the email.
Immediately forward any suspicious messages that you receive to the following email address: CorporateCommunications@alfuttaim.com
CorporateCommunications@alfuttaim.com
How to spot a fraudulent email:
These emails are mostly unsolicited: i.e. they would be sent to you without you requesting any information.
The Sender email ID would typically be from free third party email providers. A few samples of recent fake email addresses are provided below:
These email addresses do not belong to Al-Futtaim.
Scams:
The content would tend to be attractive offers related to finance schemes, lottery winnings and project financing.
Senior management names that are easily available in the public domain may be used in the email to appear more credible.
Typically the email will contain multiple spelling mistakes and be unprofessionally worded, and may contain poor quality logos, which have been reproduced from the Internet.
We would like to thank you for your cooperation.

THE ALL-AMERICAN CLASSIC
The Jeep brands legendary heritage and capability have made it iconic  well-known and loved throughout the world  and its sport-utility mastery stretches back over seven decades.
The brand, which celebrated its 75th anniversary in 2016, continues to deliver on its promise to provide the worlds leading range of rugged, versatile and innovative four-wheel drive vehicles  all of which deliver class-leading capability  with the introduction of new models that meet the specific needs of a wide variety of drivers.
Every Jeep is designed with the go anywhere, do anything approach that has always been at the heart of the brand. The ultimate embodiment of freedom, Jeep designers and engineers ensure that the brand consistently delivers against its promise by creating vehicles that have to pass demanding tests before they earn the right to be called a Jeep.
As a result of this, only Jeeps are Trail Rated. This industry-leading methodology, established by the Nevada Automotive Test Centre (NATC) and Jeep engineering, objectively measures and consistently predicts the off-road performance of all Jeep vehicles, both today and into the future.
It signifies that each and every Jeep has been designed to perform in a variety of challenging off-road conditions, identified by five key consumer-oriented performance categories: traction, ground clearance, maneuverability, articulation and water fording.
This, combined with available advanced safety and security features such as Forward Collision Warning with Crash Mitigation and Selec-Speed Control, electronic stability control (ESC), Electronic Roll Mitigation (ERM), Blind-spot Monitoring with Rear Cross Path detection, Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) and trailer-sway control (TSC), means that the Jeep brand extends an open invitation to live life to the fullest through a range of vehicles that provide owners with the sense of security that they can handle any journey with confidence.
Trading Enterprises, which has over four decades of automotive experience, is the exclusive official distributor of Jeep vehicles in Dubai and the Northern Emirates. The company has invested heavily in facilities and systems to maximise customer convenience and service, and today operates a network of modern showrooms, workshops and parts outlets, with sales and after-sales facilities that offer comprehensive customer care to Jeep drivers in Dubai, Sharjah and Ras Al Khaimah.
All of Trading Enterprises service centres offer world-class service, and the company is constantly enhancing the infrastructure of the service centres, all of which are manned by staff that are trained to demanding factory standards and fully equipped with the latest machinery and equipment required to maintain vehicles in line with manufacturer standards so that customers receive the very highest level of after-sales service.
Sales of Jeep vehicles continue to increase, reflecting the introduction of exciting new models and the expansion of the range, which is attracting more new drivers to the Jeep brand. In the next few years there will be many more additions to the range, all of which will continue to combine the Jeep brands legendary off-road capability with enhanced on-road performance and comfort.
The current Jeep vehicle lineup in the Middle East comprises the Renegade, Compass, Cherokee, Grand Cherokee (the most awarded SUV of all-time), Grand Cherokee SRT8, Wrangler and Wrangler Unlimited.

From muscle cars to full-size seven-seater SUVs, the Dodge brands lineup delivers best-in-class horsepower and performance, class-exclusive technology, advanced safety and security, unmatched capability and a slew of cool features, such as LED headlamps, Dodge signature racetrack tail lamps, dual exhaust, Uconnect 8.4-inch (213.36mm) touchscreen infotainment centres and 7-inch (177.8mm) thin-film transistor (TFT) customisable gauge clusters, to name but a few.
The Dodge brand lineup in the Middle East includes the Dodge Charger and Challenger plus the Dodge Durango.
Trading Enterprises, which has over four decades of automotive experience, is the exclusive official distributor of Dodge vehicles in the United Arab Emirates.

Every vehicle in the range has been awarded a 5 star rating in the C-NCAP test ratings, which provides every driver with the confidence that both the passive and active safety features are beyond question. The quality of these cars and the value for money offered has to be experienced to be believed.
In Qatar, DOMASCO is the authorised distributor for GAC Motor, launching the brand at the Qatar Motor Show 2015 and opening the first showroom in March 2015 on Dohas prestigious Salwa Road. DOMASCOs state-of-the-art aftersales facilities add further value to the brands proposition in Qatar.

This is an exciting time to be a Volvo driver. The past few years have witnessed a departure from traditional design philosophy to a whole new school of curves and lines. While making this transition to modern design ideas, Volvo has continued down the road of innovation, as a leader in safety and autonomous driving.
The brand has always been synonymous with safety with many considering it a pioneer. This journey began way back in 1927 when founders Assar Gabrielson and Gustaf Larson decided that every Volvo car must be designed around people and safety must be the brands first priority. Built on this belief, the first Volvo car, the 2.0L V4 rolled out of the production plant in Gothenburg, Sweden. Ever since, Volvo has been driven by a unique Swedish approach to car design, which promotes the excitement of driving without a worry. This can be seen in all our models, from our earliest luxury cars, the Amazon of the 50s, the iconic P1800 to todays state-of-the-art XC90 and exciting S90.
Volvos commitment to innovation has been unwavering and continues even today with cutting-edge features that make driving a truly pleasurable experience. Present-day models come equipped with patented technologies such as IntelliSafe  a safety and driver assistance technology; and Sensus  a comprehensive navigation and entertainment system.
The brands vision is to make every car on the road completely safe in the years to come. The altruistic E.V.A. initiative was launched to share all its safety research with competitors, much like it did with its patent for the three-point safety belt in 1959, which has saved an estimated 1 million lives since.
Volvo is headed towards 3 clearly defined goals:
No one should be seriously injured or killed in a new Volvo car by 2020.
They want to give back to their clients 1 week of quality time per year through a new Volvo car by 2025.
Around 50 per cent of the cars they sell should be electric, by 2025.
Its ambition of making driving a Volvo car an exciting experience has been driven by the introduction of Drive-E powertrains, which offer more power but lesser fuel consumption. While this makes hearts beat faster, it also makes Volvo a leader in the race to reduce CO2 levels. Staying the course to a cleaner environment, Volvo already offers a broad range of award-winning Plug-in Hybrid powertrains with pure electric vehicles on their way. Add to it new designs, refined luxury and active safety features, and what a driver gets is the freedom to move, sustainably and freely.
Today, customers can choose from premium-segment car models in three versions: Sedans (S60, S90), Versatile Estates (V40, V60) and Cross-Country vehicles (XC60, XC90).
In the UAE, Volvo is represented by Trading Enterprises, an Al-Futtaim group company established in 1971. Since 1985, it has been the sole authorized company in the UAE to import Volvo cars and sell them in showrooms around the country. It is also the authorised after-sales service provider for their vehicles in the UAE and is widely regarded as a benchmark in the region by Volvo.
In Qatar, Volvo is represented by Doha Marketing and Services Company (DOMASCO), which is also the authorised after-sales service provider.

In 1991, the first IKEA store opened in the UAE. Following the vision of Ingvar Kamprad, founder of IKEA, who believed that anyone should be able to afford stylish, modern furniture, IKEA was here to create a better everyday life for the many people. Fast forward to 2021, the brand remains true to itself as it celebrates 30 years of being in the region. To mark the occasion, IKEA, the regions favourite Swedish home furnishing retailer and a part of Al-Futtaim Group is introducing new home furnishing ideas, inspirations and solutions that are sustainable, affordable and functional to support the many changes that the pandemic has introduced to life at home.
Every year, IKEA connects with thousands of people all over the world to understand what makes a better life at home. This year, understanding the impact of the global pandemic on life at home became imperative. Against the turbulence of the changing world, 78% globally agreed that home became a sanctuary with living spaces that transformed into offices, schools, gyms and playgrounds. People adjusted to an entirely new way of living, with home at the heart of their lives and started spending on refreshing their homes to match it to their emotional needs.
With healthy and sustainable living becoming a part of the consumers lifestyle, home furnishing solutions needed to evolve. IKEAs new products and solutions aim to inspire and enable the many people to live a better everyday life and become people and planet positive. As part of its celebration, IKEA is showcasing rooms and activities that support the new life at home introduced during the pandemic.
Commenting on its 30 th birthday in the region, Vinod Jayan, Managing Director at IKEA  UAE, Oman and Egypt said, Life at home has never been more important than it is today. Home has become the place where the many spend time with family, relish a meal together, indulge in cooking new recipes and exercising. With these changes, everyone is expected to build a space to pursue hobbies, spend more time in their outdoor space and also create a cosy workspace corner. And we want to be a part of this journey. As we turn 30, we want to offer new home furnishing ideas and solutions to inspire our customers to live a better everyday life.
As part of its campaign, IKEA Family members who are shopping during this period in-stores or online will have a chance to enter a raffle draw to win Dhs 30,000 home makeovers. Customers will be able to select one room or multiple rooms in their homes for the makeovers. This will be complemented with IKEA interior designers assisting in selecting the ideal furniture and designing the space.
We cannot think of a better way to celebrate and appreciate this milestone, than highlighting our 30 year old products as a token of memory that made IKEA peoples first choice for home furnishing in the region. We want to thank all our customers for the last 30 years and welcome them to the next 30 at IKEA., Jayan added.
As part of its campaign, home furnishing products that have been in the store for the last 30 years will be treated in a special way. IKEA is allowing customers who will purchase these products in-store to customize the color of products from RAST , TERJE and range and providing free home delivery on all other products.

THE QUINTESSENTIAL AMERICAN AUTOMOTIVE BRAND
The Chrysler brand has delighted customers with distinctive designs, craftsmanship, intuitive innovation and technology all at an extraordinary value since the company was founded.
Walter P. Chrysler built a company and a brand that wasnt afraid to push the limits and think outside of the box. In 1925, when he realised his dream of creating his own company, he dedicated its efforts to excellence in engineering, while building affordable, luxurious cars at a price customers could afford  that tradition continues today.
Over the past 90 years, Chrysler vehicles have become known for innovative engineering, groundbreaking style and looking more expensive than they were, the forerunner to affordable luxury.
Whether its the bold, unique design of the Chrysler 300 or the simple elegance and extraordinary driving experience of the all-new Chrysler 200, Chrysler brand vehicles reward the passion, creativity and sense of accomplishment of their owners.
Beyond just exceptionally designed vehicles, the Chrysler brand has incorporated advanced technology, safety and security and thoughtful functional features into all of its products, such as award-winning powertrains, segment-first nine-speed automatic transmissions, the innovative centre console with pass through storage and sliding cup holders in the Chrysler 200 and Fuel Saver Technology, which delivers enhanced driving economy, in the Chrysler 300.
Trading Enterprises, which has over four decades of automotive experience, is the exclusive official distributor of Chrysler vehicles in the United Arab Emirates.
The company has invested heavily in facilities and systems to maximise customer convenience and service, and today operates a network of modern showrooms, workshops and parts outlets across the UAE, with comprehensive sales and after-sales operations existing in all seven emirates.
All of Trading Enterprises service centres offer world-class service, and the company is constantly enhancing the infrastructure of the service centres, all of which are manned by staff that are trained to demanding factory standards and fully equipped with the latest machinery and equipment required to maintain vehicles in line with manufacturer standards so that customers receive the very highest level of after-sales service.
Sales of Chrysler vehicles continue to grow steadily, reflecting the succession of innovative product introductions that continue to solidify the brands standing as the leader in design, engineering and value. The premium for the Chrysler brand is in the product, not the price.

THE TOTAL PACKAGE
Since its launch as a stand-alone division in 2009, the Ram Truck Brand has steadily emerged as an industry leader with one goal: to build the best pickup trucks in the industry.
Creating a distinct identity for Ram Trucks has allowed the brand to concentrate on core customers and features they find valuable. Whether focusing on a family that uses a Ram 1500 day in and day out or a hard-working Ram 3500 Heavy Duty owner, Ram has the truck market covered.
In order to be the best, it takes a commitment to innovation, capability, efficiency and durability. Ram Truck invests substantially in its products, infusing them with great looks, refined interiors, durable engines and exclusive features that further enhance their capabilities.
This commitment has seen Ram trucks receive many accolades  for example, in 2015 the Ram 1500 received the Consumer Guide Best Buy Award for Large Pickup Trucks for the eighth straight year, and was named Fleet Truck of the Year by Automotive Fleet magazine, an award driven by reader input  the second time in three years that Ram Truck has earned the publications top honour.
Truck customers, from half-ton to commercial, have a demanding range of needs and require their vehicles to provide high levels of capability. Ram trucks are designed to deliver a total package and the Ram brand continues to beat the competition in the most sought-after titles; fuel economy, payload and towing capacity.
Trading Enterprises, which has over four decades of automotive experience, is the exclusive official distributor of Ram trucks in the United Arab Emirates.
The company has invested heavily in facilities and systems to maximise customer convenience and service, and today operates a network of modern showrooms, workshops and parts outlets across the UAE, with comprehensive sales and after-sales operations existing in all seven emirates.
All of Trading Enterprises service centres offer world-class service, and the company is constantly enhancing the infrastructure of the service centres, all of which are manned by staff that are trained to demanding factory standards and fully equipped with the latest machinery and equipment required to maintain vehicles in line with manufacturer standards so that customers receive the very highest level of after-sales service.
Sales of Ram trucks have shown consistent year-on-year growth, reflecting the introduction of exciting new models. In the next few years there will be many more additions to the range featuring the unique combination of American engineering and design.

In cooperation with the Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation, Al-Futtaim has announced the graduation of 11 graduates from the automotive division of SINYAR, its pioneering programme for the UAE dedicated to developing and accelerating emerging talent across its organization, in partnership with Loughborough University in the UK. The SINYAR programme aims to develop and grow the capabilities of UAE Nationals and international talents with a focus on innovation and leadership through the provision of dedicated specialized programmes and career opportunities to suit the passions of aspirational employees.
Mr. Omar Al Futtaim, Vice Chairman of Al-Futtaim commented,  Through this tailor made programme, Al-Futtaim aims to play a leading role in the marketplace as an incubator to develop and nurture local talent to increase their readiness to occupy professional and leadership roles in the public and private sector. We encourage both Emirati and international employees to take the lead on aspects related to their career and development to reach new heights. It enables Al-Futtaim and its employees to identify opportunities for its teams professional and personal development across the Group. O ur people are our strongest asset and we recognize that investing in them is the most important investment we will ever make. Building on our history, innovation, and pursuit of excellence, we launched SINYAR to ensure we have an effective mechanism in place to mentor and build on our talents and gain the knowledge that they will be a part of Al-Futtaims future development and progress.
The graduation ceremony took place at Al-Futtaims Innovation Hub and was attended by delegates including Mr. Omar Al-Futtaim, Vice Chairman of Al-Futtaim, HE Nasser bin Kharbash, Under-Secretary for Emiratisation Affairs at the Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation.
Commenting on the graduation, Abdulrahman Saqr, Acting Group Director Human Resources at Al-Futtaim said, The UAE is a cosmopolitan country with many nationalities and one of its strengths has always been its human talent. This is the same for Al-Futtaim; our people are our strongest asset and we recognize that investing in them is the most important investment we will ever make. Building on our history, innovation, and pursuit of excellence, we launched SINYAR to ensure we have an effective mechanism in place to mentor and build on our Emirati talents and help build the business leaders of tomorrow. Saqr also stated that all Sinyarees that went through the programme have had their careers advanced , which was one of its main goals.
The 12-month programme that was developed in partnership with Loughborough University in the UK, consisted of six modules: Foundations for Management, Generating Customer Loyalty, Managing Business Performance, Digital and Social Media and the Retail Car Market, Finance for Managers and Operations Management. Delivered by University professors, the course was tailored to Al-Futtaim and the automotive sector in particular.
Paul Willis, President of Automotive at Al-Futtaim added: We are thrilled to see the achievement of our graduates today. The leadership at Al-Futtaim have played a vital role in the development of this prestigious program in partnership with one of the top educational institutions in the UK. The programs successful execution falls under Al-Futtaims commitment to invest in our talents and accelerate their development. We truly believe it is our duty to find the right formula to grow our local UAE talent to create the best pool of talent possible. We are committed to continuing to create role models for the UAE across our entire organization by supporting our Emirati talent to grow to their full potential.
Speaking on behalf of the graduates Salah El Deen explained: The program us grow personally and professionally and we had the opportunity to apply what we learned and gain greater roles and responsibilities. I went from a regional manager in the UAE to a national manager which is a great advancement and all my colleagues went through the same leaps.
The name SINYAR in Arabic means the wake left by a boat and was used to signify how it will lead employees on the right path for their careers and make the journey together. It was developed as an initiative to help Al-Futtaim harness the full potential of its national human capital by maximizing, nurturing, and attracting and retaining the best talent.
SINYAR is another initiative as part of Al-Futtaims commitment to accelerating the development of Emirati talent as a leading UAE multinational. Influenced by the message of the Legacy of Zayeds aspiration, the platform is designed to tell Emiratis Here You Can, which embodies every UAE Nationals responsibility to follow the direction set by the nations leaders, which bear the symbolic hallmarks of pride, credibility and optimal opportunity for nationals to succeed in the private business sector.

ALERT FOR FRAUDULENT EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES
Every Internet user must be aware that members of the public receive unsolicited emails containing fraudulent employment opportunities. Please understand that at some point, we at Al-Futtaim and its associated companies and subsidiaries, could be misrepresented by such an attempt and we offer this advice for your protection.
Fraudulent employer emails often contain fake offers of employment requesting personal information or payment to process a job application or a payment to process your visa. Kindly note that no Al-Futtaim business will ever request payment or fees for processing job applications.
If you receive an offer of employment which you are unsure of, or think could be fraudulent, please contact: afg.hsu@alfuttaim.com
afg.hsu@alfuttaim.com
How can you recognise a fraudulent offer of employment?
Our email addresses always end in @alfuttaim.com and our Recruiters will never email you from personal or free email accounts such as Hotmail, Yahoo or Gmail.
All Al-Futtaim job vacancies are advertised on our central careers website http://www.afuturewithus.com/ so any job advertised ONLY elsewhere should arouse your suspicions.
http://www.afuturewithus.com/
We will only hire you if we have discussed a role with you over the phone or face to face. Therefore, an offer of employment without any interview is most likely to be a fraudulent offer.
If you have never applied for a job vacancy with us, you should probably suspect you are the target of fraud if you receive an unsolicited employment offer.
If you would like to work with us, please apply on our central careers website http://www.afuturewithus.com/ so you can be certain that you are dealing directly with Al-Futtaim.

Back to Automotive
Founded in March 2021 by Aravind Mani and Vipin George, River wants to offer a standout design and innovative technology through its electric scooters.
Its first product, the Indie, is the result of 20 months of research and development. The vehicle, which is an electric two-wheeler, has covered over 100,000 kilometers in testing.
Unlike existing EV scooters from Ola Electric and Ather Energy, Rivers Indie features 14-inch wheels instead of 12-inch wheels. The dual-tone scooter also includes crash guards and front-foot pegs to provide safety and comfort. It also features a 12-liter lockable glove box with a USB charger and 43-liter under-seat storage.
George, who previously worked as a group head designer at Honda in India, used his experience to make Indie look unique in the segment. This scooter is designed for solo entrepreneurs and households looking for a two-wheeler to carry goods for their shop or office. Additionally, it has a dual-tone finish to appeal to young commuters looking for a newly designed electric two-wheeler.

Always a helpful place, ACE is helping visitors take conscious measures towards a greener future this World Environment Day.
The home improvement destination is collaborating with Green Land Recycling , a local waste recycling management company, to recycle electronic and electrical waste, also known as e-waste. This sustainable initiative launches on June 5, World Environment Day, and will be a permanent free service available to customers in Dubai.
Green Land Recycling
What kind of e-waste does ACE offer to recycle?
ACE offers recycling of batteries as well as home and kitchen appliances. Those looking to recycle old batteries can do so at any ACE store in Dubai, while appliances can be dropped off at ACE in Dubai Festival City.
ACE accepts most batteries including alkaline, lead acid, primary lithium, lithium ion, nickel metal batteries, and zinc carbon. The only type of battery it is unable to accept for recycling are those with nickel cadmium in them.
The Dubai Festival City store offers recycling of all appliances including IT gadgets such as laptops and mobile phones, as well as home and kitchen electronics like kettles, toasters, microwaves, refrigerators, washing machines, and air conditioners. ACE also has plans to offer this service at its Festival Plaza store shortly.
The importance of recycling electronic waste
When conventionally disposed, e-waste makes its way to landfills where harsh temperatures unleash toxic chemicals into the air, damaging the environment as a result. These toxic chemicals also seep into the ground, polluting soil and groundwater, impacting land and marine life.
E-waste that is dropped off at ACE is collected, sorted, shredded and baled by Green Land Recycling, and sent to downstream vendors and manufacturers for further processing and reuse. Green Land Recycling also ensures that any hazardous materials collected are safely disposed of, following the Dubai Municipalitys guidelines.
Now in its 30th year in the UAE, ACE is actively offering solutions that help customers improve their homes and the environment around them. ACE takes great pride in its range of sustainable initiatives, making the UAE a greener place with customer support and eco-conscious partnerships.

FAMCO (Al-Futtaim Auto & Machinery Company), the UAEs leading heavy vehicle and machinery importer, has launched its new cutting-edge Volvo Trucks range as it reinforces its market-leading position in the Emirates.
The new-generation FH, FM and FMX heavy-duty trucks have been redesigned to deliver even higher levels of productivity, class-leading safety features, as well as a more driver-friendly experience with an enhanced driver interface, interior space and overall visibility. These advanced models deliver a stronger return on range, giving users an environmental and financial saving in the process.
FAMCO and Volvo Trucks have been partners in the UAE since 1978 and have established a solid relationship that extends far beyond just the initial sales cycle. With the support of the Swedish truck brand, FAMCO has invested in state-of-the-art facilities and software that works with the customer to ensure world-class levels of service, uninterrupted parts availability and, most importantly, reduced downtime for vehicles in the field.
Revealing these new trucks in the presence of members of the Volvo Trucks international team is not only an honour, but also a return to some form of normality for us at FAMCO, said Ramez Hamdan, Managing Director of FAMCO and Commercial Vehicles. FAMCO and Volvo Trucks truly are a team working closely together on a daily basis. And that is the secret to the success of these two brands, which then benefits our customers. Bringing class-leading products to the market and providing the support and guidance our customers need, regardless of their industry or usage.
In these challenging times, launching our new FH, FM and FMX models in the UAE has been a real team effort from everyone involved, Frank OConnor, Vice President  Middle East and Turkey, Volvo Trucks International.. With a strong focus on the driver environment, safety and productivity, this new line-up will help us to deliver on our promise to be our customers best business partner. We can do this by, by helping them to develop the best drivers  responsible driving behaviour can help reduce emissions and fuel costs, as well as helping reduce the risk of accidents, injury and unplanned downtime, all of which will make them more competitive and profitable.
Volvo Trucks flagship model, the new Volvo FH is the next generation of truck designed with the driver in mind. This model features a re-imagined cab, innovative safety features and a driver focused working environment. A key aim of the new design is to give the driver a more productive, safe and comfortable life on the road. The new generation Volvo FH combines the most successful elements from the previous FH series with smart technologies and a functional, human centric design. The result is an intelligent and sophisticated truck that helps the driver deliver outstanding performance under any conditions.
The bold new look of the exterior is characterized by the signature V-shaped headlights which have now been moved outwards to align with the feature line of the cab doors. The turn indicators have also been moved to the door, giving the truck both improved aerodynamics and a more confident look. The wiper panel is cleaner and slimmer while a bigger iron mark makes the new Volvo FH easily recognizable even from a distance.
Moving inside the cabin is easier than ever with the new slimmer, ergonomically designed I-Shift gear selector. There is also a wide range of customization options with new fabrics and colours.
The attention given to drivers is most obvious in the updated interior working environment. Their workspace is centered around a modernized dashboard which features a fully digital 12-inch high resolution instrument display. The instrument display allows the driver to choose between four different screen views (two as standard), depending on the driving situation and the information they prefer to have displayed.
An optional 9-inch side display can provide infotainment, navigation assistance, transport information and camera monitoring. The display, that is easy to reach, allows the driver to interact in numerous ways: with the intuitively positioned buttons on the steering wheel, through voice control, or directly via the touchscreen and display control panel. The All new FH globetrotter cabin includes re-designed gear selector, spacious storage spaces, 3 USB slots, 33 Liter refrigerator and other features which helps the driver to have a fatigue free driving experience.
Coming to fuel saving, the trucks come with the Innovative Volvo Torque Assist feature, which helps in saving fuel up to 8% in a 100T application, with potential to increase this saving to a big extent. The factory fitted cab park coolers on the FH trucks ensure that the drivers still have an AC supply even when the truck engine is shut down, thus saving customers considerable amount of fuel loss.
Further enhancing Driver comfort, the Downhill Cruise control is re-introduced as a standard feature on all the new models. It prevents the truck from exceeding the speed set by the driver and can be used in combination with the service brakes, and an option of improved Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) that works at all speeds, even down to zero km/h.
The Electronically controlled Brake System (EBS), which is a prerequisite for safety features such as Collision Warning with Emergency Brake and Electronic Stability Control, now comes as a standard with Drum brakes on the new trucks. Volvo Dynamic Steering, with the safety systems Lane Keeping Assist and Stability Assist, is also available as an option.
Other features like AGM batteries, Clutch able air compressor helps in reducing the downtime as well as increasing the efficiency of the vehicle.
The new Volvo FM is designed to attract drivers with a new cab and better visibility. The new Volvo FM heavy duty truck will be the ultimate workplace on wheels in all segments.
The all new redesigned cab has raised A-pillars that give it up to one extra cubic meter of space and more light. It also comes with smart technology that underpins Volvos focus on creating the ultimate space for drivers. The exterior of the next generation Volvo FM has a new aerodynamic shape, with distinctive lines on the front and a single sleek character line sweeping the side of the all new cab. In addition, the V-shaped headlamps are positioned for optimal aerodynamics, and the larger brand identity panel and upper front grille with a new mesh pattern give the truck a bold, confident look.
The Globetrotter new sleeper cab has been upgraded with a raised bed and improved storage possibilities that include a large storage compartment underneath the bed and an upper rear storage with LED panels in the compartment dividers. Additionally there is a 28 Liter refrigerator also equipped specially for UAE market. To move from the seat to the bed is easier than ever with a new slimmer, ergonomically designed I-Shift gear selector. Cab comfort is further enhanced through reinforced insulation that helps keep out cold, heat and noise.
The interior is highlighted by a new dashboard offering more storage space, new colors and a modern dynamic display. The cluster includes a 12-inch high-resolution instrument display with a user-friendly interface where the driver can easily see important information and select between different screen views, depending on the driving situation. The instrument display, which comes ready for future updates and connected services, is designed to simplify the drivers interactions and minimize distractions when accessing critical information
To provide economic advantage to the customers, features like Volvo Torque Assist & clutch able air compressor are equipped to save fuel and AGM batteries are added in place of conventional enhanced flooded batteries which have excellent cycling ability and cold cranking performance. Tire pressure monitoring system has also been added which makes it possible for the driver to supervise the tyre pressure through the instrument display. A correct tyre pressure gives an optimal use of the tyre and leads to increased lifetime and decreased fuel consumption.
The all new Volvo FMX with an entirely new cab, increased payloads and innovative safety features will improve customer expectation in areas such as sustainability, cost efficiency, safety and productivity.
The new Volvo FMX is built on an entirely new cab platform, based on Volvos long and successful experience of delivering robust and functional construction trucks. The completely new cab includes a front section with easily replaceable sturdy parts, headlamp protectors and new V-shaped LED headlamps. To make it easy for drivers to enter or exit, weve designed new anti-slip footsteps.
The new Volvo FMX comes with increased space in the day cab and storage of up to 800 liters. Drivers also get improved visibility thanks to a lowered door line and new rear view mirrors. The visibility can be improved further by adding a camera as an option on the passenger side which provides a complementary view of the side of the truck.
The interior is characterized by a new dashboard with more storage space, new colours and a modern cluster. It includes a dynamic 12-inch high-resolution instrument display with a user-friendly interface allowing the driver to immediately see relevant information and select between four different screen views, depending on the driving situation.
The new FMX also comes equipped with a new traction control panel that helps the driver easily and quickly handle potentially dangerous situations, both on and off the road. The driver can gain more traction by engaging the differential locks in an easy way, by turning a knob, viewing the traction status on the instrument display at the same time. A new steering wheel with a neck tilt option offers the driver a more ergonomic driving position.
The new Volvo FMX features the heaviest addition to Volvos chassis range  a 38-tonne bogie that allows for a Gross Vehicle Weight (GCW) of up to 58 tonnes. This is the biggest GVW offering here in the Middle East.
For particularly rough applications like mining, the Volvo FMX comes with an optional steel roof hatch with an emergency exit handle that removes the entire hatch. By designing the robust new FMX construction truck that can carry more tonnes and maneuver more easily, while keeping the driver safe and comfortable, Volvo Trucks can help increase both productivity and profitability in the construction industry.

With COP28 concluding on a historic climate agreement, electric and green mobility is now more than ever at the centre of automotive industry transformation. One of the major groups that has emerged as a driving force of this transformation is Al-Futtaim Group, the Strategic E-Mobility Partner of COP28.
Through numerous initiatives and partnerships, the Al-Futtaim Group further solidified its long-standing commitment to sustainability and its strategic focus of developing an extensive electric mobility ecosystem in the UAE. This ecosystem was centre-stage on the Al-Futtaim Stand at COP28, as the group showcased its formidable EV portfolio covering brands such as Polestar, Volvo Cars and BYD; alongside its EV charging technology  Charge2Moov, as well as the regions first electric construction equipment, the Volvo ECR25 electric compact excavator and first electric two wheelers, River.
The stand also featured the regions first IMI-certified Electric Mobility Training Centre launched by Al-Futtaim Automotive, as well as their recently launched hyper-immersive VR-based automotive showroom, a groundbreaking addition to the automotive experiential sector.
Al-Futtaim Group also announced several noteworthy partnerships at COP28
To empower and prepare UAE nationals for automotive jobs of the future and augment the nations electric mobility expertise, Al-Futtaim Automotive signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the UAE University to jointly engage in scientific and academic research activities and training programmes within the cutting-edge Electric Mobility Training Centre. This move aims to cultivate a future-ready talent pool for the countrys fast-rising e-mobility sector.
Marking another major step towards a cleaner, greener mobility future in the UAE, Al-Futtaim Automotive collaborated with ENOC Group and DEWA for the opening of a new green hydrogen station in the UAE. The company will provide four hydrogen-powered fuel cell Toyota Mirai vehicles for testing and real-world use, pioneering new research and trials for green hydrogen.
Community initiatives to drive environmental stewardship & green mobility awareness
The Group also launched an environmental initiative, committing to plant a Mangrove tree for every visitor taking a sustainability pledge on the Al-Futtaim Stand. Through the Blue App, visitors pledged to integrate sustainable habits into their lifestyle, and the company will plant an equivalent number of trees, in partnership with leading social enterprise, Goumbook.
The Al-Futtaim Group also launched a nine-week campaign of raising awareness on green mobility through its E-Mobility Zone at Dubai Festival City Mall. Each week, the stand featured one of the electric or hybrid brands from Al-Futtaim Automotives portfolio, giving audiences a chance to interactively learn about electric and hybrid technologies, and each brands sustainability targets and roadmap.
Survey results revealed, offering insights into changing perceptions of EVs and UAE market
During COP28, Al-Futtaim Automotive also commissioned an extensive survey exploring the challenges, customer mindset and readiness of UAE residents to shift to Electric Vehicles (EV). Done in partnership with YouGov, the survey revealed that 63% of UAE residents plan to make EVs their primary mode of transport within the 2 years; while 7 out of 10 residents predict that the UAE will have EV charging stations every few kilometres in the next five years. Furthermore, the survey also revealed major barriers stopping UAE residents from making the shift, highlighting that 44% residents are not able to install a charging station at home.

COP28 green mobility fleet, powered by Al-Futtaim Group
The company provided a fleet of 360 New Energy Vehicles (NEVs) and 8 electric buses to Dubai Police and Roads & Transport Authority (RTA) as well installed Charge2Moov electric charging stations for the conference. Al-Futtaim Group also trained and certified Dubai Taxi Company (DTC) drivers to operate a fleet of electric vehicles to provide top-notch transportation for VIPs attending the event.
Reflecting on the milestone COP28 partnership, Antoine Barthes, Vice-President, Al-Futtaim Automotive, shared : COP28 was one of the most significant moments for the UAEs sustainability story, and more so, for our commitment to green mobility. Al-Futtaim Group and its division Al-Futtaim Automotive stepped onto the global stage to clearly convey that our journey is not just about electric vehicles; its about steering an entire industry towards a sustainable future. Its about building a robust ecosystem where everyone in the UAE has an opportunity to minimise their carbon footprint and mark an important contribution towards our collective net-zero goals. A comprehensive, integrated ecosystem that includes NEVs, buses, trucks, two-wheelers, charging stations and EV aftersales support  this connected and inclusive ecosystem will redefine the way people and goods move more sustainably.
Antoine Barthes, Vice-President, Al-Futtaim Automotive, shared
Being named the Strategic E-Mobility Partner of COP28 was a proud moment and we believe this is the beginning of a new journey of working more collaboratively and consciously with all automotive stakeholders. Surely its a catalyst for positive change, aligned with the UAEs target of becoming a carbon-neutral nation by 2050.
Looking ahead, the group aims to further exemplify its commitment to sustainability and set a precedent for transformative green mobility solutions in the region by collaborating with governments, organizations, and communities to create lasting value for both society and the environment. In addition to the Mangrove tree plantation, the company will also be upcycling a billboard made of vinyl PVC to produce sustainable and eco-friendly bags to be distributed among students from various schools.

Leasing is a convenient fixed-cost mobility plan and a great option without worrying about the ownership of the vehicle. It is completely hassle-free, with a low initial down payment, and an all-inclusive monthly lease amount.
Leasing makes it easier to get more car for less money because you only pay for the use of the vehicle for one, two or three years, instead of paying for the vehicle itself. This way, you get to keep upgrading to the latest models more often.
Warning
You may have to pay penalties if you pay off a loan/financing early.
If you do not meet the repayments/payments on your loan/financing, your account will go into arrears. This may affect your credit rating, which may limit your ability to access financing in the future.

Al-Futtaim acquires Marks & Spencer's retail business in Hong Kong and Macau
Al-Futtaim has today confirmed the acquisition of the Marks & Spencer franchise in Hong Kong and Macau. The sale, which completed on 30 December, sees Al-Futtaim become the new sole franchisee for M&S in Hong Kong and Macau.
Al-Futtaim has worked in partnership with M&S since 1998 when it opened Dubais first M&S store. Following the purchase of 27 Marks & Spencer stores in Hong Kong and Macau, Al-Futtaim now operates 72 Marks & Spencer stores across 11 markets in Asia and the Middle East.
Stephen Rayfield, Vice President M&S and Sports & Lifestyle Division at Al-Futtaim said: We are delighted to strengthen our long-term partnership with M&S and expand Al-Futtaims international footprint to Hong Kong and Macau. Al-Futtaim looks forward to building on our solid foundations as we continue to enrich our customers lives and aspirations through the provision of quality products and services in Hong Kong and Macau.
Paul Friston, Marks & Spencers International Director, said: We have substantially reshaped our International business, which has improved profitability and positioned us for growth. As one of the worlds leading retail operators, with strong logistics capabilities and local expertise, Al-Futtaim is the ideal partner for us to develop and grow our business in Hong Kong and Macau.
The sale follows M&Ss strategic review of its International business in November 2016, where M&S proposed to have a greater focus on its established franchise and joint venture partnerships and operate with fewer wholly-owned markets.

Al-Futtaim Technologies (AFT), one of the regions leading systems integrator, has been awarded a contract by Emirates Investment Bank (EIBank), an independent private bank based in Dubai, to upgrade its datacenter.
The contract will see the Al-Futtaim company work closely with IT solution provider Dell EMC and its distributor Arrow to supply, install and configure EIBanks primary and hot site (disaster recovery site) including servers, storage, and backup and provide complete data migration from the existing storage platform to Dell EMC Unity 500F All Flash storage.

Working alongside our partner we were able to showcase the advantages of the server and storage solutions to the EIBank team.
We are confident our team will be able to execute the project with minimal disruption to EIBanks services while providing the highest levels of service to meet and exceed their expectations, he added.
At Emirates Investment Bank, our clients are at the core of everything we do. This upgrade of our data centre is important because it will help us maximise operational effectiveness and deliver greater IT efficiency to our clients. We are pleased to be working with Al-Futtaim Technologies and Dell EMC, said Imad Bou Khouzam, Chief Financial Officer of Emirates Investment Bank.

ALL NEWS AUTOMOTIVE CORPORATE FINANCIAL SERVICES REAL ESTATE RETAIL NEWS Dubai Festival City Mall Aims to Recycle 75% of Waste by 2022
In a bid to reduce the malls ecological footprint, Dubai Festival City Mall is embarking on an ambitious journey in partnership with the French-based utility company, SUEZ Water Technologies to reduce its waste by 75% by 2022. This initiative falls in line with Dubai Festival Citys efforts and the Dubai Governments plans to attain 75% of waste diversion from landfills by 2021 [1] . Dubai Festival City Mall currently recycles 11% of its waste and aims to boost its sustainability numbers year on year to reach its 2022 targets. Al-Futtaims Festival Plaza, scheduled to open at the end of this year, will also aim to achieve the same sustainability targets for 2022.
[1]
The waste recycling program promotes a holistic and world-class program that saves energy, reduces waste and generates revenue. It also contributes to the global green economy and eliminates any unnecessary degradation. The program will be executed in three phases to ensure a smooth transition with no implication on customer experience and create maximum efficiencies across all retailers at the mall.
The mall management will be working closely with all retailers to provide training to their employees about the importance of recycling to achieve Dubais 2021 vision so they can play a critical role in the programs success. The process will also take into consideration the specific requirements of each retailer and have ongoing evaluations to assess the efficiency of the processes implemented. The process will eventually be digitalized through a smart application to monitor the waste and recycling processes and provide visibility on the efforts of each participant.
Dubai Festival City Mall is known as the ultimate destination for shopping, dining and entertainment in Dubai, but it is also critical for us to be sustainable. Having a positive impact on our environment is a priority and we are working towards creating an environmentally friendly ecosystem that engages both our partners and customers throughout this sustainability program. We are delighted to have partnered with SUEZ, who are globally renowned for their water and waste management solutions, to bring our mall innovative solutions, backed by their 150 years of expertise.  said Steven Cleaver, Director, Shopping Centres Dubai, Al-Futtaim Malls.
The waste recycling program also aims to engage customers throughout the process, giving visitors a chance to contribute to saving the environment while also enhancing their overall experience at the mall. During the third phase, Dubai Festival City Mall will reward visitors that have contributed to this program by providing Reverse Vending Machines onsite to incentivize positive behavior and motivate visitors to make further contributions to the planet.

Al-Futtaim breaks ground on Festival Avenue, as Cairo Festival City Mall becomes largest shopping center in Egypt
As part of its expansion plan in Egypt, Al-Futtaim Group has announced the launch of the new expansion of Cairo Festival City Mall, called Festival Avenue in the heart of New Cairo. The groundbreaking for the new expansion was carried out by Mr. Omar Al-Futtaim, Vice Chairman of Al-Futtaim Group, in the presence of the groups management, several public figures, representatives of major retail brands in Egypt, and a group of media professionals and representatives from Egypt and the region.
The major expansion marked the celebration of the six-year anniversary of Cairo Festival City Mall and its success story in Egypt. The new expansion, with investment exceeding two billion EGP, will add a gross leasable area of 22,000 sqm to the existing mall, making it the largest mall in Egypt.
The event is an important day in the history of Al-Futtaim Groups investments in Egypt, specifically Cairo Festival City Mall. The announcement reaffirms the groups vision for Egypt as one of the promising markets that has witnessed a huge economic and social boom over the past years, to become an important market for retail trade.
Timothy Earnest, Group Director  Al-Futtaim Malls spoke enthusiastically about the expansion, explaining that Cairo Festival City Mall has become a gateway to New Cairo and the hub of many distinguished events. He also pointed out that the new expansion called Festival Avenue, offers an exceptional and unique experience for customers by presenting a new retail concept in Egypt of international standards.
Since the establishment of Cairo Festival City Mall, it has proven to be one of the most successful investments of the Al-Futtaim Group in the Egyptian market. Since its opening in 2013 and until 2019, the mall has managed to reach the highest employment rate, providing about 5,000 direct job opportunities for Egyptians, and 15,000 indirect opportunities, he added.
Al-Futtaim Group aims to achieve strategic goals by enhancing Cairo Festival City Mall and its contribution to the development of the retail sector in Egypt. The most important among these goals is the increase in the field of shopping tourism, that witnesses an increasing boom in the world. To achieve these goals, Cairo Festival City Mall seeks to enhance the cooperation with the tourism sector, tourism companies and airline operators to coordinate attractive programs for tourists with direct presence in Festival Avenue. Cairo Festival City Mall continues to participate in global retail platforms through international conferences such as RECON and MAPIC.
Commenting at the event, Hayssam Hajjar, General Manager, Cairo Festival City Mall stated, Our plans will address the demand from retail brands wanting to be based at Cairo Festival City Mall, ranked the leading shopping destination in Egypt for the third year in a row, according to TripAdvisor. The mall continues to deliver unique experiences for our retailers and customers, who accounted for 23 million visitors in 2019 alone.
The new expansion will be seamlessly integrated with the current mall, including easy navigation, airy corridors, open sightlines and plenty of natural sunlight through a state-of-the-art 5,300sqm skylight. Signature services will be offered for shopper convenience including VIP Valet Services, shop and drop services, free high-speed Wi-Fi, and many other services that provide seamless and integrated experience for our customers, he concluded.
The new expansion will add 80 new stores, including numerous international brands and 15 food and beverage outlets. With the new Festival Avenue, Al-Futtaim Group will achieve added value to the existing mall  which has won three RECON Awards in 2019  as well as making radical changes in the retail market by providing diverse options for shoppers from stores and premium brands.
Festival Avenue will evolve the scope of the existing mall with a variety of indoor and outdoor alfresco dining options offering local and international cuisines, with an international 1,600 sqm Food Hall. By adding over 1,000 additional parking spaces, the mall will be able to hold 7,800 cars for shopping convenience  providing an unparalleled shopping and lifestyle experience to Cairo Festival City Mall.
To provide a global destination for shopping and entertainment, an elevated entertainment complex will be made available within the new expansion for games and leisure activities for all age groups and will introduce a new concept of entertainment to Egypt.
Festival Avenue brings to Cairo Festival City Mall, new luxury brands to truly elevate shoppers experience with a range of products from watches and jewelry to mens and womens fashion.

Festival Plaza Opens Doors To Customers At Wasl Gate
Al-Futtaim today opened the doors to its 64,800 square metres shopping centre, Festival Plaza, located in Wasl Gate Community in the South of Dubai. The new mall was opened in the presence of Mr Omar Al Futtaim, Vice Chairman of Al-Futtaim Group, Timothy Earnest, Group Director of Al-Futtaim, and Al-Futtaim employees, mall staff and community members.
The retail precinct will serve as a convenient and local lifestyle destination, consisting of 120 stores in addition to key flagship stores IKEA, Marks & Spencer and Lulu Hypermarket. This is complemented by a 500-seat food court, over 40 dining and eating options, a Stay and Play offering, family entertainment Kids Club and over 2,300 parking spaces.
The construction of Festival Plaza began in 2017 and required a total of 14.5 million man-hours and around 4,000 manpower to complete the project. The Mall is built around its customers needs, which were identified through extensive research in order to truly address customer demand. The convenience of its location gives it a distinct advantage as well as providing customers with access to anything they may need in their everyday lives. With this destination, Al-Futtaim Malls is bringing to life the Festival brand of celebration, in a lively and convenient way that appeals to the community that surrounds it.
Timothy Earnest, Group Director of Al-Futtaim Malls commented: We are excited to welcome our first customers at Festival Plaza today. This is another milestone on our journey as we position ourselves as the leading malls and retail experience developer in MENA. The addition of Festival Plaza with all it has to offer strengthens our mall portfolio and reiterates our position as retail pioneers in the region.
Al-Futtaim is committed to providing customers with the best in class experiences and celebrations from shopping, entertainment and dining. Today, we extend our Festival brand and its celebratory concept to the South of Dubai to offer community members a contemporary destination that combines spectacular experience and convenient services that meet their day to day needs, he concluded.
One of the highlights of the destination is the biggest IKEA store in Dubai which also opened its doors to customers today. The store is spread across 35,500 square meters including a 5,000 square meters training area for IKEA employees and is also home to the Worlds Tallest IKEA Navigation Tower. IKEA Jebel Ali will also be home to the first IKEA bakery in the UAE that offers customers the chance to taste mouthwatering traditional Swedish baked goods such as rye bread, cinnamon bun, baguettes and croissants.
Lulu Hypermarket is set to provide customers with their everyday essentials across its 4,586 square metres of space, of which 85% is allocated to Grocery Food and Fresh Foods when it opens at the end of December. This is the first time Lulu hypermarket customers can sit in and eat their freshly prepared food from the live stations that offer fresh Sushi, Pasta and Pizza. Cheese connoisseurs can enjoy a selection of over 700 cheeses imported from around the world.
Families and friends can dine at the 500-seater food court and choose from the 13 global food chains available including Popeyes, KFC, Pizza Hut, Hardees, and Baskin Robbins amongst others. Meanwhile customers looking to unwind and dine in style have 40 cafes and restaurants to indulge in, offering a variety of cuisines including American, Arabic, Japanese, Chinese, Indian, Turkish and Italian. The regions first Grain of Salt restaurant is set to open in the following weeks and give customers an exemplary culinary experience with its vibrant live cooking stations.
The mall will also have a stay and play facility which allows children to spend time playing while the parents shop or run errands at the mall. The communities nearby can also take advantage of the Kids Club, which has an eventful calendar of activities that will keep little ones busy all year round.
From day of launch until Christmas, kids can enjoy face painting, cookie decorating for some festive fun, with caricatures on offer for the adults. The mall will have a variety of family fun on offer for all visitors, including four secret rooms connected by an infinity tunnel that will be discoverable through Festival Plazas Instagram page and a confetti room for people to snap their own photos of the 60 seconds of celebration. Finally, Festival Plaza will be the first mall with its own community garden. Children will be able to plant their own plants each weekend as well as attend workshops to watch the progress of their plant. All participants will receive a certificate and seeds to takeaway and replicate what they learn at the workshops.
With a multitude of retail, dining and entertainment options and 2,310 parking spaces, Festival Plaza serves as a convenient and family lifestyle mall easily accessible from Sheikh Zayed Road, fifteen minutes from Dubai Marina and Palm Jumeirah and a few minutes away from RTA Energy Metro Station.

Rene Lacoste entered the legend of tennis when he and his teammates The Musketeers, stole the Davis Cup away from the Americans for the first time in 1927. The true story of the Crocodiles began in 1927, Rene Lacoste liked to recount how his nickname became an emblem recognised throughout the world. Rene Lacoste was nicknamed the Alligator by the American press, after he made a bet with the captain of the French Davis Cup Team concerning a suitcase made from alligator skin.
The captain had promised to buy it for him if he won a very important match for their team. The public must have been fond of this nickname, which conveyed the tenacity he displayed on the tennis courts, never letting go of his prey! Rene Lacostes friend then drew a crocodile, which he then had it embroidered on the blazer that he wore on the courts.
In 1933, Rene Lacoste and Andre Gillier, the owner and President of the largest French knitwear manufacturing firm of that time, set up a company to manufacture the classic logo-embroidered shirt. The champion had designed this for his own use. Fresh, contemporary, classic are the keywords that come to mind when one looks at Lacoste stores and their quality sportswear, footwear and accessories.
Derived from the brands unique and rich heritage in tennis, golf and yachting, Lacoste stores provide the perfect setting for the exclusive lifestyle epitomised by the legendary alligator, Rene Lacoste.

Dubai Festival City Mall is set to feature a winter wonderland filled with truly joyful decorations and themed attractions that will create memorable moments for all visitors throughout December.
Parents from across the United Arab Emirates are all invited to bring their children to Santas Grotto in Dubai Festival City Malls main events atrium, Festival Square, between 10th to 27th December for a special meet and greet with Santa daily between 4 pm and 10 pm on weekdays and 4 pm to 12 pm on weekends.
Children visiting the mall during the festive season will also enjoy an artificial snow play area and engage with snowmen and reindeers. Families can take photos in Santas Grotto by making a small donation to the Al Jalila foundation, a UAE-based non-profit charitable organisation that promotes medical education and research in the Emirates.
This is a very special time of the year for everyone. We want families to come and feel the cheerful ambiance throughout the mall while they also enjoy a shopping spree at the over 30 brand new stores that we recently launched as part our AED 1.5 billion mega expansion project, said Brad Merchant, General Manager, Dubai Festival City Mall.
During the upcoming season, parents and their children will also have an opportunity to enter a giant globe with artificial snow at Festival Square and seal the unique moment with a picture.
This programme will give customers a chance to explore many new features that we are introducing at Dubai Festival City Mall to enhance the shopping experience and make everyone have an amazing time while enjoying this wonderful and festive spirit, concluded Brad.

Al-Futtaim brings Homeworks to home improvement enthusiasts in Egypt
With over EGP 70 Million in investments, Al-Futtaim has officially inaugurated Egypts first Homeworks store at Cairo Festival City, bringing Al-Futtaims newest home improvement and lifestyle brand to Egypt for the first time.
Essam Hafez, Country Manager of Al-Futtaim Retail in Egypt said: Homeworks offers an exclusive destination for customers in Egypt to find everything they need for their homes under one roof, closing an existing market gap.
With the growing complexity of securing quality, timely labour and craftsmanship, Homeworks not only offers customers a wide range of trusted products and smart solutions, it also taps into a growing interest in DIY (Do It Yourself) and home improvement products, Hafez added.
Homeworks offers a wide range of world renowned and exclusive brands across the categories of DIY and hardware, outdoor living and garden, home improvement and home living.
Ashley Dymond, General Manager, Homeworks said: To become the trusted brand of choice for inspirational home lifestyle solutions is not just our vision, it is our commitment. That is why we are keen to provide products and services that deliver more value to our customers than any competitor.
Offering customers the opportunity to experience the products before buying, Homeworks moments of inspiration come to life through its dedicated hubs around the store, where product experts and store associates are trained to assist customers to ensure a rewarding shopping experience. Families with children, meanwhile, will appreciate the dedicated kids area, where they can leave their children to play as they shop.

The name has been chosen in recognition of Al-Futtaims successful Festival City Malls brand located across the MENA region, which is synonymous with quality shopping and lifestyle destinations, but with a clear differentiation. In line with Al-Futtaims strategy for the Mall, it will serve as a convenient and welcoming lifestyle destination appealing in particular to the nearby communities including Jebel Ali, Dubai Marina and those commuting from Abu Dhabi.

Timothy Earnest, Group Director Retail Malls said, With our sights keenly fixed on the future development of Dubai and our confidence in the growth potential during the build up to Expo 2020, we see Festival Plaza becoming a major urban lifestyle destination. As a company with innovation and drive at our core, we are setting a precedence amongst shopping, dining and retail destinations by creating a world-class offering that focuses on delivering sustainability initiatives utilising technology, as well as convenient services designed for the end-consumer.
Since we broke ground last year, we have received a hugely positive response from residents and keen interest from retail groups both internationally and in the UAE, and are very much looking forward to welcoming them.

The Plaza, with 64,800 sq. metres of leasable space, will in total host approximately 100 retail outlets, a food court and caf-style dining, entertainment, a hypermarket and an Al-Futtaim ACE hardware store  all set to be completed Q4, 2019.

Al-Futtaim signs Industrial Valley land deal with King Abdullah Economic City in KSA
Al-Futtaim has signed an agreement with King Abdullah Economic City (KAEC) for the purchase of a 325,400 square metre land plot in Saudi Arabias Industrial Valley for the development of a logistics and distribution facility.
Our decision to invest in the Industrial Valley component of the visionary King Abdullah Economic City development was made in consideration of the valuable strategic location it occupies on the Red Sea coastline and adjacent to King Abdullah Port on one of the worlds busiest shipping routes. From King Abdullah Economic City we will be able to execute our expansion plans and meet the ever-increasing demand for our highly diverse portfolio of products, said Omar Al Futtaim, Vice Chairman, Al-Futtaim.
The citys strategic location allows it to serve not only the markets located around the Red Sea, but the entire world. The companies already operating in the Industrial Valley have been exporting their products through the adjacent King Abdullah Port since it became operational in January 2014. Work is in progress on the development of further industrial plots to meet the continuing demand for leased and freehold industrial lands. KAEC has so far attracted more than 110 leading national and international businesses, of which 20 are currently in operation and 30 are under construction.
King Abdullah Economic City has been extremely successful in attracting the capital investment of more than 110 leading national and international companies because they know that King Abdullah Economic City is the ideal place to invest in across the region. The city has become the destination of choice for investors seeking to expand into Saudi Arabia and the wider GCC and Red Sea regions, said Fahd Al-Rasheed, Group CEO and Managing Director, King Abdullah Economic City.
Rayan Qutub, Chief Executive Officer, Industrial Valley, highlighted the importance of the strategic partnership: Al-Futtaim, a company that enjoys a solid reputation in regional and international markets, will add value to the logistics industry, one of the fastest growing clusters in the Industrial Valley, he said. The Industrial Valley has become the new manufacturing and logistics hub, thanks to its highly efficient, comprehensive logistics services supported by direct access to King Abdullah Port and the national rail and road network. It offers an access point to over 250 million consumers in the Middle East and East Africa, and Al-Futtaims investment reconfirms the trust that King Abdullah Economic City has gained among leading businesses.

MARCH 8, 2017
Doha Festival City, Qatars largest entertainment, retail and dining destination continues to deliver on the commitment to bring visitors a world class shopping experience, and surprise and delight customers with the installation its first art piece. Created by visionary artist and sculptor, David Harber, the bespoke Sculpted Torus, is now pride of place in the Malls Centre Court. The impressive sculpture, four metres in diameter, will wow guests visiting the Mall when it opens on 5th April 2017.
The piece is an adaptation of David Harber Ltds iconic Torus and is part of a series of five variations that will be installed at Doha Festival City. The unique Sculpted Torus is made from mirror-polished, marine grade stainless steel and will sit alongside a succession of smaller, 2m Torus  all of which will be slight variations of the original design.
Trevor Hill, General Manager, Doha Festival City, said, We are delighted to have collaborated with a renowned artist like David, and truly excited to be bringing his art to Qatar for the first time  showcasing his brilliant talent. Doha Festival City is more than just a shopping destination, it is a place where visitors will be able to take advantage of a huge variety of entertainment, retail and dining, in addition to premium design art concepts which are big, bold and have the wow factor, just like our Mall.
David Harber is also producing a 4m bronze Keystone Ring with a Verdigris finish to be located outside one of the main entrances to Doha Festival City Mall, and is currently designing some hanging tree canopies to be placed in the two glass atria of the North Food Court.
As with all David Harber sculptures, each of the bespoke Torus commissions for Doha Festival City will be designed and handcrafted in his Oxfordshire workshop, in England. By April 2017, all of the pieces will have made the journey from the British countryside to Qatar. David Harber Ltd is renowned for its overseas work, and in 2016, was honoured with The Queens Award for Enterprise in International Trade.
The installation of the sculptures forms part of the finishing touches to the Mall, as Doha Festival City prepares to open next month. With over 500 local and international brands and more than 100 places to dine and relax, there will be an unparralled choice of indoor and outdoor entertainment attractions unique to the country. Easily accessible following the completion of the dedicated ramps from Shamal Road Doha Festival City is perfectly situated for the ultimate day out.

AL-FUTTAIM MOTORS ANNOUNCES PARTICIPATION IN THE GLOBAL TOYOTA DREAM CAR ART CONTEST
Al-Futtaim Motors has announced its participation in Toyotas global initiative, Dream Car Art Contest, designed to inspire creativity in youth and encourage interest in making the world a better place, which will run from 2nd December 2015 until 21st February 2016.
The competition will be open for children aged five to 15 across three categories, with gold, silver and bronze awards being granted across all three groups. The three categories will feature entrants aged 5  7 years old, 8  11 years old and 12  15 years old.
The Toyota Dream Car Art Contest is being conducted as part of Toyotas social contribution initiatives. It gives children throughout the world the opportunity to develop an interest in cars and helps them feel the joy and importance of having a dream. Toyota Dream Car Art Contest invites children from all corners of the globe to share ideas about the future of mobility by drawing their dream cars, allowing them to express their creativity, thoughts and dreams with the world at large.
A total of nine finalists from the UAE will have their artwork submitted to the global competition in Japan, representing the top three artworks from each age category. An award certificate and prizes will be presented to the gold, silver, and bronze award winners in the UAE, with a chance to be invited to the award ceremony to be held in Japan later during the year, should their artwork be shortlisted.
While in Japan, winners will visit a Toyota factory and get to experience different facets of the Japanese culture. Additionally, the top nine local finalists will receive a professional painting set, while the top three local finalists will be given a further art studies endowment, compliments of Al-Futtaim Motors.
Saud Abbasi, Managing Director, Al-Futtaim Motors said Last years edition of the Toyota Dream Car Art Contest saw an impressive showing of more than 12 schools and over 1,000 children participating on a local level, a fantastic feat in itself for a first edition in the UAE. It was even more impressive to have Minhal Sami, an Emirati talent recognised with the first Toyota Engineering Inspiration Award, a very special award granted to the entry that most inspires Toyotas automobile production staff. We hope this achievement inspires more young artists to join our contest for the upcoming year.
The Toyota Dream Car Art Contest kicked off at the Christina Noble Childrens Foundation (CNCF) annual fund raising event sponsored by Al-Futtaim Motors in collaboration with Hertz, in-line with Al-Futtaim Motors and Toyotas efforts to provide a better future for upcoming generations.

IKEA rewards co-workers for achieving highest levels of customer service competence
FEBRUARY 29, 2016
IKEA has conducted a new award programme for customer service competence named Samya and Mustafa Awards, in which all co-workers at IKEA Dubai Festival City were assessed on their competence in the five key stages of customer service: smile, greet, approach, engage, and farewell.
Following daily assessment by duty managers, the scores of over 1,960 assessments conducted during a six month period were combined with mystery shopping results as well as customer assessments. Co-workers scoring 100 per cent in the assessments and who scored highly in the other areas were put forward for recognition.
An award ceremony was held at IKEA Dubai Festival City on 12th January, attended by over 100 co-workers. The winners received certificates of appreciation presented by Helle Palmans, General Manager HR, IKEA, Justin Roberts, Customer Relations and Operations Manager and Ricardo Pinheiro, Store Manager, IKEA Dubai Festival City.

Cairo Festival City Mall invited its customers to 'sharethelove'
FEBRUARY 24, 2016
In February, Cairo Festival City Mall ran an engaging in-mall and online activation using the hashtag #sharethelove, which invited mall visitors to take a photo in a special booth in the main court, and post it on Instagram for the chance to win an exclusive three-course meal for two in the Amphitheatre provided by the malls restaurants.
The activation successfully attracted over 200 contestants, from which 14 winners were selected to dine with their special one at an exclusive setup overlooking the Dancing Fountain. The couples enjoyed music from singing duo Onsy and Natalie, and received the dedicated service of private waiters, making it a memorable and romantic occasion at Cairo Festival City Mall. The highlight of the night saw one lucky attendee win a brand new Amici Vespa.
Two influencer couples, including online presenter Sherine Hamdy and radio presenter Yara El Gendy, were also invited, and their coverage of the event increased online reach, while Cairo Festival City Malls fans and user-generated content spiked throughout the weekend.

Al-Futtaim Motors extends multiple offers on selected 2015 and 2016 Toyota models
Al-Futtaim Motors has extended its attractive Zero Down Payment Purchase Plan on selected 2015 and 2016 Toyota models throughout March, and is also offering an optional zero per cent interest rate plan, allowing customers to own a brand new Toyota at incredible value for money.
Customers can purchase their car over three years at zero per cent interest on selected vehicles, or can spread payments across four or five years at the low interest rates of 0.99 per cent and 1.25 per cent respectively. Additionally, customers buying their cars through the unique Toyota Personal Contract Purchase programme can do so at a low rate of 0.99 per cent for two years.
The offers are available separately to qualifying customers, ensuring that anyone wanting to purchase a brand new Toyota can choose the plan that best suits their needs.
Saud Abbasi, Managing Director of Toyota at Al-Futtaim Motors, said: Our February Zero Down Payment offer was received extremely well by customers throughout the UAE, as it relieves them from the hassle of securing a substantial up-front payment. Working with some of the largest financial institutions in the UAE, we were able to secure good interest rates for qualifying customers, making the purchase of a Toyota much more appealing.

LEXUS OPENS UNIQUE LUXURY BRAND EXPERIENCE 'INTERSECT' IN DUBAI
Lexus has announced the official opening of Intersect by Lexus, in Dubais iconic Dubai International Financial Centre, second after the luxury brand experience space in Tokyo with a glamorous launch party featuring award winning DJ and music producer, Mark Ronson.
Intersect by Lexus is a unique luxury space where people can experience what is truly quintessential of Lexus without getting behind a steering wheel. Designed by Masamichi Katayama, the world-renowned interior designer, Intersect by Lexus is distinguished by an intricate bamboo facade that filters natural light through miniature spindle grille motifs, the same spindle grille that carries the new design direction of Lexus cars. Neither a dealership, nor a traditional retail space, guests are able to engage with Lexus through food, design, art, fashion, music and technology at its inviting eatery, curated library, creative boutique and innovative garage.
Intersect by Lexus is a unique, versatile and multi-purpose space. Its inspiring decor and carefully curated library makes it the perfect place for people to work remotely amidst creative, like-minded people. It also serves as a destination to relax, meet friends or grab a healthy bite without the fuss. With a calendar full of exciting culturally engineered events and activations planned for the months to come, we hope to become a reference for those seeking a more culturally charged lifestyle through a series of design, art and fashion talks and workshops, said Benjamin Nicholas, Head of Intersect by Lexus.
We are very proud to be inaugurating this unique space, which we like to think of as a home away from home, or a third space, where people have the opportunity to see the world through the eyes of Lexus and experience the brands passion for great design and craftsmanship in a whole new way, said Saud Abbasi, Managing Director, Al-Futtaim Motors.
Intersect by Lexus will be hosting a variety of events and exhibitions, from jazz nights to design and art workshops and various other talks. Located in Dubai International Financial Centre, Village Gate 7, guests are welcome from 8 am to 12 pm, Sunday through Friday. For more information, please visit http://www.lexus.ae .

LEXUS LAUNCHES THE GS F TO REVEAL AN EXHILARATING LUXURY SPORTS SEDAN
Lexus has announced the launch of the performance-oriented GS F four-door sports sedan in the Middle East. With a style eminently suited to everyday driving, the Lexus GS F conveys the appeal of the F series to a wide demographic, thus enabling Lexus to further enhance its brand image of exhilarating performance.
The Lexus GS F embodies the philosophy of the F series which stands for fast dynamic response, high efficiency and seamless performance on everyday roads in addition to racetracks that can be enjoyed by everyone. It is the first new F series sedan model since the launch of the Lexus IS F in 2007. The Lexus GS F is based on the partially revamped Lexus GS model and boasts outstanding performance: the 5-litre V8 engine features enhanced response and engine-revolution smoothness, while chassis stiffness has been improved through cutting-edge technologies such as laser screw welding.
The interior and exterior of the Lexus GS F fuse a breathtaking simplicity and elegance of design, and capture the mature, luxurious sportiness unique to the F series. In addition, the vehicle utilises the Lexus Safety System+ active safety package to provide a multi-faceted approach to active safety, further enhancing the safety and peace of mind of its occupants.
The key features of the Lexus GS F include a high-performance direct injection four-stroke gasoline engine with a superior version (D-4S). The 5-litre V8 gasoline engine also emphasises sound, dynamic response and acceleration. The engine delivers 471 horsepower at 7,100 revolutions per minute and 54 kilogrammes per metre of torque at 4,800 to 5,600 revolutions per minute. The GS Fs V8-engine also comes with an equally efficient gearbox; the 8-speed Sport Direct Shift (SPDS) automatic transmission that offers smooth shift feel, excellent drivability, instantaneous acceleration and exceptional fuel economy under all driving conditions.
The Lexus GS Fs suspension parts have been redesigned with the aim of achieving the ideal geometry. The steering response has been improved by retaining high suspension rigidity, optimising roll stiffness, and by harmonising these with the steering system. The front fascia is defined by an aggressive representation of Lexus trademark spindle grille, featuring a new black lacquer plated lower moulding exclusive to the F series, which provides downforce to the front of the car. In addition, the centre pillar and outer mirrors are painted in a dark, glossy metallic hue. The newly designed, 19-inch polished aluminium wheels are first forged, and then subjected to three-dimensional cutting. A new white LED interior illumination concept has been implemented in the interior of the Lexus GS F and combines warmth with superior illumination qualities.

REDESIGNED TOYOTA RAV4 BRINGS DYNAMIC NEW STYLING AND AN ADVENTUROUS SPIRIT
Al-Futtaim Motors has announced the launch of the newly redesigned RAV4, one of Toyotas most popular crossover vehicles, featuring newly redesigned exterior styling and interior refinement, coupled with Toyotas legendary fuel efficiency, performance and exciting driving dynamics, making the 2016 Toyota RAV4 the perfect choice for any adventure.
Available in four different grades: EX and VX (42), as well as GXR and VXR (44 full-time), the 2016 Toyota RAV4 is powered by a fuel-efficient 2.5 litre naturally aspirated four cylinder engine, producing 177 brake horsepower at 6,000 revolutions per minute and 23.8 kilogrammes of torque at 4,100 revolutions per minute, mated to a six-speed automatic transmission for smooth driving on all road surfaces.
Alan Carpenter, Toyota General Manager  Sales and Marketing, Al-Futtaim Motors, said: The Toyota RAV4 has been one of our best performing vehicles since the launch of the fourth generation in 2013. It was the worlds original crossover sport utility vehicle when it was introduced in 1994, and 22 years later, it remains one of the most loved vehicles in the Toyota line-up, thanks to its versatile capabilities and stylish look.
With this last iteration, the 2016 Toyota RAV4 has new and exciting exterior styling thanks to a redesigned front fascia with LED headlights and daytime running lamps, LED taillights, and 18 inch alloy wheels for a sportier, more aggressive look. The interior also gets new treatment, with new two-tone leather seats, a seven inch navigation system and an all-new eight inch rear seat entertainment system on select models.
The 2016 Toyota RAV4 is currently available at all Al-Futtaim Motors showrooms across the UAE, with prices starting at AED 84,900 for the EX model, an exceptional value of AED 99,900 for the VX model which includes leather seats, sunroof and navigation, and AED 114,900 and AED 124,900 for the GXR and VXR models respectively.
For more information, customers can visit the newly redesigned Toyota.ae website where they can book a test drive, download brochures or enquire about any Toyota vehicle of their choice.

Alan Carpenter, General Manager  Sales and Marketing, Al-Futtaim Motors said: This is the first time Al-Futtaim Motors is running a promotion such as this, and we hope it gives people the confidence to be able to invest in their dream Toyota without having to worry about up-front payments.

Al-Futtaim Motors leaps into the future with the launch of Toyota Prius in the UAE
Al-Futtaim Motors has officially launched the fourth generation Toyota Prius, the most popular hybrid vehicle in the world.
First revealed at the 13th Dubai International Motor Show in November 2015, the Toyota Prius was the worlds first mass-produced hybrid vehicle (petrol-electric) when initially launched in 1997, and has since sold over 3.5 million cars around the globe. Close to two decades on, the Toyota Prius brings with it ground-breaking environmentally-friendly performance, a bold new design, and a fun-to-drive spirit. The new Prius also features enhanced safety in a more compact package that is lighter in weight with world class aerodynamic, delivering an enhanced fuel efficiency of 26.1 kilometres per litre.
Saud Abbasi, Managing Director of Toyota at Al-Futtaim Motors, said: Introducing the Toyota Prius in the UAE is a gigantic step forward in empowering the drive for a more sustainable environment. In line with the UAE Governments vision for a greener future, Al-Futtaim Motors is proud to be leading the positive change with this new addition to the Toyota family. Converting the kinetic energy generated from braking into electricity, the car requires no external charging, making it one of the next immediate motoring solutions for the rising environmental issues in the region. We predict that the fourth generation Toyota Prius, which enjoys a bolder design, ground breaking environmental performance, and a fun-to-drive spirit will appeal to young trendsetters who want everything that is new and cool, with the added benefit of being environmentally ethical and brimming with technology that does not confuse.
Employing a petrol engine and an electric motor, the Toyota Prius can be powered by the engine, the electric motor or a combination of both, automatically choosing the most efficient mode for the best mileage and lowest emissions.
The new 2016 Toyota Prius will be offered in two grades, Dynamic model available at AED 89,900, and the Iconic model, available at AED 97,900.

Al-Futtaim Motors participates in Dubai Municipality's 'Car Free Day'
Al-Futtaim Motors has participated in the seventh annual Dubai Municipality Car Free Day initiative, under the patronage of His Highness Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Crown Prince of Dubai.
Car Free Day which took place on 21st February 2016, encourages government and private sector employees as well as members of the public to use public means of transport rather than private vehicles, in an effort to reduce the UAEs carbon footprint, in line with the UAE Governments Expo 2020 goals and UAE Vision 2021 to protect the environment and natural resources.
Al-Futtaim Motors displayed a range of hybrid cars from Toyota, Lexus and Toyota Material Handling Equipment, giving visitors to Dubai Municipalitys offices the chance to witness the future of sustainable mobility first-hand.
Al-Futtaim Motors has implemented a number of initiatives to increase awareness on carbon emissions, and help individuals and organisations better understand hybrid technology and how eco-friendly vehicles can help create a more sustainable future in the UAE. We worked closely with Dubai Municipality and a number of taxi operators by providing them with Toyota Camry Hybrid vehicles that not only save fuel, but also decrease CO2 emissions substantially. On the consumer front, we have just launched the new Toyota Prius, the most popular hybrid car in the world, and we believe the car will be very well received in the market. Besides, Lexus enjoys the largest fleet of hybrid vehicles in the UAE and globally, including the recently launched completely redesigned Lexus RX h, said Yousuf Ali Al Raeesi, General Manager, Government Relations, Health Security, Safety and Environment, Al-Futtaim Motors.
A recent study found that a fleet of Camry Hybrid vehicles can provide a fuel savings of up to 31 per cent over a period of 13 months, amounting to approximately AED 1,200 per vehicle every month. Over a period of four years, the savings amount to an impressive AED 55,000 per vehicle.

Al-Futtaim Motors launches all-new tough and sophisticated Toyota Innova
Al-Futtaim Motors has launched the all-new 2016 Toyota Innova, which combines the essence of a Multi-purpose-vehicle (MPV) with the tough, emotional elements of an SUV and seating for up to eight passengers.
Designed with the concept of being a multi-performance vehicle thanks to the tough and sophisticated exterior, the enhanced interior and the new powerful and efficient powertrain for improved driving dynamics, the all-new Innova proudly stands out within the MPV segment. Aside from the redesigned exterior, the new Innova makes use of an improved and fortified frame, resulting in better handling and a more comfortable ride. With its strengthened frame and SUV-inspired styling, the Innova delivers a spacious and comfortable journey regardless of the road or weather conditions.
Saud Abbasi, Managing Director of Toyota at Al-Futtaim Motors, said: The Light Commercial Vehicle (LCV) market is one of great importance to Al-Futtaim Motors, driving a substantial part of our business. Last year, the Toyota LCV line-up recorded an average of 8 per cent growth, while the LCV segment itself saw growth of 4 per cent average.
This performance is influenced to a great extent by cars like the Innova, which has traditionally been extremely popular among Taxi operators and SMEs, as well as by individuals looking for a reliable and versatile vehicle that, like all other Toyota vehicles, delivers complete peace of mind. With the new generation, we are offering even more grades that will cater to an even wider audience, fulfilling any need or requirement.
The new Toyota Innova is available either as a 7-seat model (with captain seats for the second row) or with an 8-seat (60/40 split, fold-down seats for the second row) configuration options. Ergonomic shapes and materials coupled with optimal seat firmness, provide second-row seat passengers with enhanced ride comfort.
The new Innova is available with a 2.7-litre 4-cylinder engine which produces 164 hp and 25.0 Kg-m of torque, mated to a 6-speed Super-intelligent Electronically Controlled Transmission that delivers enhanced fuel economy and driving performance. For added convenience and comfort, the Innova comes with a cruise control function and an all-new air-conditioning unit that helps maintain a cool interior  even in traffic on a hot day at maximum occupancy.
The all-new Innova is available in 6 exterior colours across all Al-Futtaim Motors showrooms, with prices starting conveniently at AED 92,900 for the SE grade, AED 98,900 for the SE+ grade, and AED 102,900 for the top of the line Limited grade.

F&F has unveiled its Spring / Summer 2016 Collection introducing a deeper side to the luxe romantic trend. Against a blanched colour palette, the collections usher a minimalist aesthetic with an ultra-modern finish. Woven fabrics play a key role in creating the seasons loosely draped shapes.
Troy Zunckel, General Manager  Fashion, Retail Division, Al-Futtaim said: Spring / summer means the launch of new ideas, new hopes and aspirations and we have done just that with giving the classic nautical look a contemporary twist. The range is adventurous and playful, mixing and matching unconventional palettes and silhouettes. We hope that customers will enjoy the collection as much as we do.
In Ladieswear, chambray textures play a key part in distressing sharper silhouettes. Solid co-ordinates shape formalwear, as versatile statement pieces update existing favourites. Classic double breasted jackets in salmon and coral show a playful approach to pink. Casualwear in a darker hue sees silky linens in navy, and loosely draped fabrics form delicate pleats in effortlessly cool culottes. Tactile fabrics are seen in romantic blouses with intricately embroidered ruffle sleeves.
Menswear carries a nauti-cool clean cut, in soft summer blue and underwater shades. Layering is the foundation, through versatile textured knits. Slim fit linen blend shorts are paired with a grain-textured suit jacket for relaxed formalwear, or with a Breton tee. Woven canvas accessories complete the maritime look.
In Kidswear, the girls collection is inspired by watery sapphire and cobalt blue tones. Vintage pink and lemon shades pep floral printed dresses and zip-up jackets whilst casual pretty chiffon tees and crochet cover ups are accented with hand crafted embroidery and gold lace.
Boyswear bears the true surfer spirit, as indigo yarns and wave dye fabric refresh jersey tees and zip-through sweats. Tropical beaches and tribal Aztec prints inspire graphics, as an ocean colour palette is accented by acid citrus tones. In casualwear, woven look jersey denim cut off shorts stem a new tide of freedom.
Also available are matching accessories for all categories including shoes, bags and jewellery.

MARCH 21, 2016
GUESS previewed its stunning Spring / Summer 2016 collection on 21st March at a themed fashion show in Dubai. The cool laidback vibe of Greeces islands was recreated at the venue, drawing in the theme of the Spring / Summer campaign.
The crowd witnessed fashionable trends, exquisite designs and luxurious silhouettes in various hues of blue and bright colours across womenswear and menswear and the show also showcased fashion-forward accessories.
The spring womens GUESS collection is a denim-focused assortment injected with unique, lightweight pieces that deliver an instant trend-focused look. Denim and chambray are seen in many silhouettes featuring fresh new takes on detailing.
This season, modern slim-fit button-down shirts in white, chambray and eye-catching patterns dominate the mens GUESS spring collection and serve as a seasonal staple thats never going out of style. The GUESS guy opts for a more effortless cool vibe wearing laid-back jeans and shorts paired with unbuttoned shirts with rolled up sleeves.
The Marciano Spring 16 collection includes effervescent florals in peach, fuchsia, coral and teal in light-weight maxi dresses and romantic tops cater to Springs brighter colour palette and add a touch of femininity.
The handbag collection offers a selection of fashion-forward designs including drawstring bucket bags, oversized totes and structured satchels in a wide range of textures and patterns. In a departure from GUESS classic G monogram, the logo is re-invented using pops of 3D G cubes. For footwear, lace-up gladiator and 70s inspired fringe are trend driven elements added to sandals, block heels and platform wedges in a variety of heights, colours, prints and fabrications.
The new spring summer 2016 collection is available at GUESS, Marciano and Accessories stores in the UAE, Bahrain, Kuwait, KSA, Qatar, Egypt and Lebanon.

rooted in Paris but with an unmistakably international outlook, ba&shs designers have created and produced four new limited-edition pieces for the Middle East.
They are shaking up conventions and banking on subjective sensuality in which only the wrists, hollows above the collarbone and ankles will remain visible.
The dress  a key wardrobe item and symbol of femininity  has been naturally reinterpreted in three designs.
Long floaty dresses with sparkling floral prints on silk and lurex blend fabrics give this collection a fusion of elegance and glamour.
A long sunray-pleated skirt completes this wardrobe, bringing a romantic note to the look, which will be the perfect match for the other pieces in the Spring Summer 2017 collection.
Available in several sun-kissed colours, gold and midnight blue add luminosity, warmth and contrast. Collection available from June 2017.

April 18, 2017
The new Art Event 2017 collection, from the Swedish home furnishing retailer IKEA, has launched across all IKEA stores this April. Introducing a limited-edition collection which features 12 posters with hand-drawn motifs from a carefully curated selection of artists from all over the world.
The 2017 collection is the third installment within the series, as IKEA strives to provide people all over the world with affordable and functional designs, and continues its mission to also make great art accessible for everyone.
The Art Event 2017 collection is created by enlisting some of the most exciting, established and up-and-coming artists from around the world to contribute to a collection of posters featuring works drawn by hand. The style of the collection is highly eclectic and diverse with the artists using everything from graphite, pen and ink, crayon, charcoal, watercolor, gouache and pastel.
Hand drawing is a fascinating art form, it reminds us of what it is to be human in a world driven by speedy technology and digital development says Henrik Most, Creative Leader for ART EVENT 2017. These drawings are full of sensuality and tactility, almost leaving the fingerprint of the artist right there on the surface of the paper, he continues.
HellO is composed of two outstanding artistic talents that emerged almost twenty years ago in Brussels. Jrme Meynen and Antoine Detaille have produced an astonishing array of drawings featuring creatures that may at first seem graphically pleasing and simply imaginative, but who on closer examination often reveal profound symbolism. We try to translate and merge our separate visions into the same drawing, says Antoine. Most importantly, we hope it makes you smile.
Jean Julliens Shelfie is a perfect example of his playful reflections on the times that we live in. I hope that the name of the piece can speak for itself! he says. The poster is inspired by a Jeans reflection on a quote from Chuck Palahniuks cult film Fight Club. The things that we possess end up possessing us. The French-born Royal College of Art graduate presents a humorous take on that concept and also how the human element fits when it comes to creating balance. This balance having to rely purely on the individual is something I thought could be interesting, he says. A literal take on this idea.
The drawing that Kevin Lyons brings to the IKEA ART EVENT represents the energy of his Monsters. They are constantly moving and shaking, beatboxing and breaking. The watercolour echoes that energy and movement through texture and colour, he says. The EMMY winning designer and creative director goes on to explain that there is a deliberate sense of colouring outside the lines and being a little messy.
I wanted to create a funky portrait of some of my favourite Monster characters all stacked up on top of each other, he continues. I feel it is the way they would draw me if IKEA asked them to do so.
Like many artists of his generation, Hahan is acutely aware of worldly demands, and his poster reflects what he calls his view about the friction of some commercial forms, the art market, and deeper still  how money is being interpreted in our society. He speaks eloquently about the importance of imagination, freedom, and hunger in todays world. In this work, my intention is to show not only how people have to cover their basic needs, but also how peoples existence is affected by the bills that follow them until the end of their lives, he says. Our lives can be more fulfilled if we can first cover our bills, or else doing so can become the focal point of our entire existence.

UAE residents consider the UAE their home and are living here in excess of five years, a piece of research by Swedish home furnishing retailer, IKEA  part of Al-Futtaim group of companies, has unveiled.
When asked where they would call home, 93% revealed their strong attachment to the country by citing the UAE, whilst more than two-thirds of those questioned have lived here for more than five years.
The research, which was commissioned by IKEA to accompany its latest regional advertising campaign, Home is Here, aimed to understand what transforms a house into a home  which in the UAE is often rented and not owned.
The insights revealed that for most (more than 60%), the kitchen is the heart of the home. Many cited that the activities that took place in the kitchen, made the house feel more like home to them. Whether it was cooking with friends and family, (32%) or being able to make a mess in the kitchen freely (30%). Additionally, almost a quarter of the respondents (23%) when asked What makes your home a home? responded that home was being able to relax and regularly throw a house gathering.
These insights into the UAEs love of entertaining also positions us to be a very welcoming nation, for example, frequently hosting meal gatherings and inviting friends and family over to share that experience. Over three-quarters of the respondents (76%), have hosted at least one such gathering in the past month.
UAE residents living with either their own children or younger siblings, had their own light-hearted, insights to share. Over half these respondents cook almost daily with the younger family members, highlighting the importance of quality family time. Whilst the polls also showed that almost 60% of the respondents let their children jump on their beds, and in retrospect, the kids were the messiest residents of the household (45%).
Whilst many people spend significant time and money in decorating their home, IKEA was also keen to find out what household items make its inhabitants feel most homely. Over half of the respondents (53%), believed that it was the little things around the house that made it feel more like home. Whether it was the pillows, the accessories, the customized picture frames or the plant pots, as opposed to larger furniture items.
Vinod Jayan, Regional General Manager  IKEA UAE, Qatar, Egypt and Oman said, To see that most residents view the UAE as their home just goes to show what a great place it is to live and highlights the fact that more and more people are choosing to lay down their roots here. At IKEA we know that your house is very much a part of that feeling of belonging and that the kitchen is at the heart of everyones home  whether it is entertaining friends or spending time with family. This is the reason for us to launch our latest campaign, Home is Here  we want to remind you that it is not about where you come from, but all the things you do in your house that turns it into your happy home.

Gentlemen will enjoy shirts resplendent in charming prints: florals, botanicals and the finest geos, or a Hawaiian holiday shirt for those of a tropical disposition. Lightweight round-neck layering pieces are worn with a deconstructed blazer or butter-soft grey suede bomber jacket, whilst formalwear is sleek and simple: a refreshing mint green windowpane-check jacket, with pearl-rimmed and herringbone-engraved buttons.
The new Ted Baker store is located at City Stars, Nasser City Cairo, Phase 1, Level 3.

The 2017 Camry retains the same 2.5 L engine producing 181 horsepower, delivering class-top engine performance, while the responsive handling and heightened comfort were achieved thanks to the more dynamic suspension which was introduced last year.
Four grades are available, starting from AED 83,900 for the Camry S which includes a new Tyre Pressure Monitor System (TPMS), Vehicle Stability Control (VSC) and rear fog lamps, while keeping features such as Keyless Entry, Steering Wheel Audio Control, Cruise Control and Bluetooth from last year. Camry SE is priced at AED 89,900 and comes with a new Auto Light Switch, as well as Tyre Pressure Monitor System (TPMS), Vehicle Stability Control (VSC) and rear fog lamps, as well as 10-spoke 17-inch alloy wheels. Priced at AED 96,900, SE+ comes with all the SE features, in addition to a sunroof, push-start button, leather seats and a 4.2 TFT Display Unit for a more sophisticated interior.
The new Limited package now includes a distinct front sport grille with red garnish, along with a rear bumper with red garnish. New 17 15-spoke alloy wheels lend the Limited Camry a more aggressive wide stance, while the silver sport interior package and leather seats add a touch of luxury. Leather steering wheel with controls, touch-screen navigation, front and rear parking sensors, and six airbags round up the Limited package priced at AED 103,900.

Al-Futtaim Motors looks to accelerate implementation of sustainable mobility
Al-Futtaim Motors is taking part in the Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week, the largest gathering on sustainability in the Middle East, and a significant platform for international dialogue and cooperation, as the Official Transport Partner of the exhibition, held from 12th to 21st January, at the Abu Dhabi National Exhibition Centre.
Our message for many years has been that hybrid is the immediately available answer to the countrys sustainable mobility question. Late last year, we announced our intention to drive the implementation of new sustainable technologies in the UAEs motoring market and revealed our plans to start testing Toyotas latest technology, the Fuel Cell Vehicle in the UAE. Since then, the pilot consisting of testing the Toyota Mirai FCV has kicked-off successfully, cementing our commitment towards a better and cleaner tomorrow, said Bertrand Thiebaut, Senior Managing Director, Al-Futtaim Motors.
The Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week is an excellent platform for us to showcase the Fuel Cell Vehicle technology as well as our hybrid transport solutions for government, fleet and individuals as we continue to provide sustainable solutions that we believe are imperative in the governments efforts in creating a greener environment, he added.
Al-Futtaim Motors will showcase the zero-emission hydrogen-powered Toyota Mirai at its stand, as well as a model hydrogen filling station, similar to the ones being built by Air Liquide, Al-Futtaim Motors partner in the pilot and one of the most established suppliers of hydrogen stations in the world, in addition to its latest hybrid models, giving visitors the opportunity to witness current and future sustainable transport options from Toyota and Lexus.

Al-Futtaim Motors sets up hybrid discovery area at CITY WALK
Al-Futtaim Motors has set up a special Hybrid Discovery activation at the heart of CITY WALK in Dubai. As part of the companys unwavering march towards more sustainable motoring, the Hybrid Discovery area includes activities to entertain and educate the public on the benefits of driving a hybrid vehicle. Visitors can also test drive the fourth generation Toyota Prius, the worlds most popular hybrid car.
Since we launched the Prius last year, we have had a lot of interest from the public, as well as corporations and Government entities. They have all seen the value driving a hybrid vehicle can have on the environment, and of course in terms of fuel efficiency, said Saud Abbasi, Managing Director of Toyota at Al-Futtaim Motors.
Our commitment to sustainable mobility extends well beyond the Prius, as we recently launched a pilot to test the feasibility of introducing Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles to the UAE, another step in our commitment to creating a greener future in the country, Saud continued. Activities include a Future Hybrid Show, an educational show through an interactive presentation, and games involving the Toyota Prius, as well as test drives of the vehicle itself, with surprises and gifts for visitors.
Customers looking to purchase the Prius can benefit from a special offer available only for the duration of the event, and fans can follow the event live through Toyotas social media channels by using the hashtags #TheFutureIsNOW and #HybridDiscovery.
The Al-Futtaim Motors Hybrid Discovery activation will take place in the outdoors area near Roxy Cinemas, from 19th January until 28th January, from 5pm to 10pm on weekdays, and from 2pm to midnight at weekends.

FAMCO leads the way to a greener, safer and healthier work environment
FAMCO is setting new industry standards relating to safety, health and the environment, with the delivery of the first Volvo Construction Equipment C-Series pavers equipped with a fume extraction system and incorporated with the enhanced ergonomics and increased fuel efficiency feature.
Specialist asphalt contractor Al-Futtaim Colas LLC has taken delivery of the Volvo C-Series Pavers following a review of their procurement specifications to incorporate the fume extraction system, as part of its company commitments to improving safety, health and the environment.
With its tier 3-certified engine and Smart Power Mode; the Volvo C-Series paver automatically reduces engine speed to 1600 rpm. This results in substantially lower noise and up to 30 per cent reduced fuel consumption . The fume extraction system feature removes harmful fumes from the working environment at 83 per cent efficiency, and its modular design means it can be retrofitted to machines in the field.
Vladimir Knezevic, Managing Director, FAMCO UAE, commented: We are delighted to introduce another great innovation from Volvo to the UAE market; the newly supplied fume extraction system which contributes to a healthier working environment. Combined with the legacy Volvo engines, the benefits of the new system are multiplied we all strive towards a safer, greener environment.

Abu Dhabi now home to the most engaging Toyota flagship facility in the region and the largest in the UAE
Al-Futtaim Motors, leader in sustainable mobility and exclusive distributor of Toyota in the UAE for the past 61 years, officially opened the doors to the most advanced and largest Toyota facility in the UAE  The Wave  making Abu Dhabi home to an awe-inspiring flagship building and marking the companys continuous investment in the capital.
The new five-level three-in-one building is a 3S facility housing world-class Sales, Service and Spare Parts offerings, spread over approximately 14,000 square-meters and considered the largest, most sophisticated retail and service space for Toyota in the Middle East, promising to set world-class customer experience standards for all visitors be it Sales, Service or even leisure visitors .
The Wave houses more than 80 new and used models on display, while the service area includes 64 simultaneous working bays that can accommodate up to 250 cars per day.
Each step of the customer journey has been designed to include many forms of physical and digital interactions, answering visitors interests and needs during their journey at the facility.
The spaces interior has been designed by UK-based Greenspace, a design consultancy firm that specializes in creating legacy experience destinations and which has been selected for their history of working with Toyota Motor Europe and other automotive retail brands.
Some of the key features and attractions that are housed within The Wave include:
 The Toyota Design Studio for customers to build their dream Toyota using physical and digital design tools
 A Caf serving hot and cold refreshments and equipped with relaxation space that seats around 60 guests along with WiFi, charging points and TVs
 The Toyota Play Space for children to drive electric cars on a 100m indoor track, in addition to 3D printers for live printing of souvenirs, a coloring and toy-building area, and VR headsets for a unique gaming experience
 A Toyota Heritage Zone which exhibits 61 years of Al-Futtaim Motors and Toyotas partnership in the UAE
 The Toyota Handover Lounge where customers can receive new cars in a private lounge space and drive away through a dedicated departure lane
 A world-class Toyota Service Center where customers can pre-book and have their car serviced by highly-skilled Al-Futtaim Motors professionals
Saud Abbasi, Managing Director of Toyota at Al-Futtaim Motors, commented on this momentous occasion: Coming on the heels of the opening of our latest facility in Madinat Zayed, The Wave, reiterates our commitment to Abu Dhabi and aligns with our promise of being closer to our customers wherever they are. The Wave is not just a unique building that pushes the boundaries of modern architecture, it is a representation of our dedication to customer service excellence. We have designed the facility to put the customer first, and to offer all our guests interactive and engaging experiences regardless of the purpose of their visit.
Additional information for Interior Design and Architecture Publications:
Greenspace CEO and Founder Adrian Caddy, said: As a London based company with a specialist reputation, we were delighted to be chosen by Al-Futtaim Motors to work on this project. Right from the start, we were challenged by the team at Al-Futtaim Motors to create a legacy experience by setting a new global standard in retail and brand experience for Toyota, driving the brands idea of Passion for Better, which became the strategic focus and creative inspiration for all the interior elements and experiential design development over the course of The Waves development.
Interior Design
The signature style of the interior space, the use of simple lines and radiuses, as well as the overall aesthetic, all project clean, crisp and modern style. The wave-shaped curved lines of the exterior are echoed along the length of each floor by suspended white fins that are contoured from the front to the back of each floor. Glass sales booths and reception desks are all planned out to maximize customer interaction and experience with the brand. Premium quality, gallery-style lighting, supplied by Reggani, has been chosen for cars and the ambient areas, to maximise the simplicity of the showroom treatment.
Exterior Lighting
Approximately 5,000m of LED lights have been installed Cinmar Lighting Systems from Abu Dhabi, pre-programmed for animated film sequences to enhance the emotional appeal of the building from dusk onwards. The architectural lighting scheme utilizes the curving rooflines of the building as well as its louvered panel faade.
Digital Experience
The new retail flagship experience is augmented by digital screens on each floor, providing customers with information and interactivity through multiple touchpoints. The journey is heightened with digital touchscreens where guests can choose a model, the interior and exterior colors, or review accessories  all with the swipe of a finger. Two large touch screens are linked to a mirrored display, allowing the user to navigate on an interactive table without a hitch, therefore making the browsing and selection process easy and decisive.
This effective use of technology is essential to the realization and visualization of the vehicle, inside and out. The instant customization options help both the customers and sales associates make a decision through the implementation of an overall interactive experience.
These touch-points include touch screens next to each car providing specs, photos and videos. Large video walls attract attention and broadcast marketing campaigns, while interactive tables and walls help customers configure cars and families play and learn about Toyota engineering and technologies.
Where possible, the entire customer experience will be paperless, and instead, utilises digital technology to engage and inform visitors seamlessly. Each sales associate is equipped with a tablet, enabled and connected within the network. Sharing screen to screen is effortless, rewarding and timesaving, with the added feature of being able to print on command at a nearby printer.
The Wave is located in Musaffah, between 16th Street and 18th Street, near the Musaffah Police Station and Dalma mall. The Wave operates six days a week from 8am until 8pm, Saturday through Thursday. The showroom and service center are closed on Friday.

Stylish Toyota Fortuner wins Readers Choice trophy at the Wheels 2017 Car of the Year Awards
Toyota Fortuner, the highly popular seven-seat SUV, bagged Wheels Readers Choice Award at the ninth Wheels Car of the Year ceremony, the UAEs largest independent automotive awards, held recently for the automotive industry in the UAE.
Saud Abbasi, Managing Director of Toyota at Al-Futtaim Motors, said: With the medium SUV segment contributing to the growth of the automotive industry in the UAE, the Fortuner has proven to be a key player for Toyota. Its no surprise that the new Fortuner, with its fully redesigned exterior and interior styling, has become so popular since its launch last year, and we would like to thank the thousands of voters that brought this award home to Toyota.
Renowned for its durability, on-road comfort and off-road prowess, the new Fortuner features a more distinctive, sleek and powerful design with improved driving dynamics and fuel consumption, as well as a wide variety of features for additional convenience, safety and ride comfort.
The exterior has been completely overhauled, and the new Fortuner now stands longer, wider and lower. The large, slanted upper grille is framed by thick chrome plating that extends around the sleek, aggressive Bi-beam LED headlamps with integrated Daytime Running Lights (DRL), while the prominent trapezoidal front bumper creates a sense of depth.
The Fortuners ample cabin space is complemented by superb convenience features, culminating in a sublime driving experience. The interior exhibits the toughness of an SUV, tempered with the elegance of a premium sedan. Soft-touch textures and exquisite chrome detailing liberally pepper the cabin, all beautifully harmonising with the clear blue interior illumination.
The new Fortuner enjoys a 6-speed automatic transmission which maximises engine potential and multi-stage gears optimised to improve drive force in the low-speed range. The car is available in a 2.7-litre four-cylinder engine which produces 164hp and 24.9 Kg-m of torque and the 4.0-litre V6 engine, which churns out 235hp and 38.3 Kg-m of torque.
The Fortuner is equipped with comprehensive safety systems, including Anti-Lock Braking System (ABS) with Electronic Brake-force Distribution (EBD), Supplemental Restraint System (SRS) for the front seats along with a knee airbag for the driver, and three-point Emergency Locking Retractor (ELR) seatbelts are equipped on all seats.
The new Fortuner is available in 8 exterior colours across all Al-Futtaim Motors showrooms, with prices starting at AED 109,900 for the 2.7L EXR, and AED 129,900 for the 4.0L GXR and AED 145,000 for the top of the line 4.0L VXR.

Al-Futtaim Motors and Emirates Wildlife Society-WWF explore green transport solutions
In the spirit of the 2017 declaration for the Year of Giving, Al-Futtaim Motors, leader in sustainable mobility and exclusive distributor of Toyota in the UAE, has committed to support Emirates Wildlife Society in association with WWFs (EWS-WWF) vision to ensure a future where people live in harmony with nature, through the introduction of EWS-WWFs first Toyota Prius.
Thanks to the Prius lower emissions and smaller carbon footprint, EWS-WWF can demonstrate sustainability in its operations and play a role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions from road transport, knowing that the Prius can save up to 1 ton of CO2 per year.
There was an obvious synergy in Prius supporting a conservation organization like EWS-WWF, based on our shared commitment toward creating sustainable solutions as part of our commitment to a greener environment, said Saud Abbasi, Managing Director of Toyota at Al-Futtaim Motors. Prius is the immediately available solution to a problem thats been decades in the making, and its the first step in moving towards more sustainable transport, in-line with the Governments UAE Vision 2021 initiatives for a more sustainable environment and infrastructure.
Tanzeed Alam, Climate and Energy Director at EWS-WWF, said: A move to low emissions vehicles like hybrid vehicles is critical to addressing climate change and improving air quality. This will save the country significant amounts of carbon dioxide and money. We are grateful to our partners Al-Futtaim Motors for our new hybrid car, as we are committed to walk the talk and raise awareness of the need to use more energy efficient cars in the UAE.
The Toyota Prius was the worlds first mass-produced hybrid vehicle (petrol-electric) when initially launched in 1997, and has since sold over 3.7 million cars around the globe. The new Prius employs a petrol engine and an electric motor, and can be powered by the engine, the electric motor or a combination of both, automatically choosing the most efficient mode for the best mileage and lowest emissions.

Al-Futtaim Motors reinforces its environmental leadership with a large desert clean-up initiative
Al-Futtaim Motors, exclusive distributor of Toyota, Lexus, Hino and Toyota Material Handling Equipment and leader in sustainable mobility in the UAE, recently conducted a company-wide environmental initiative that saw more than 300 associates undertake a desert cleaning project in association with Dubai Municipality, Dubai Police and Dubai Rescue.
The clean-up covered close to six square-kilometres of Dubais deserts, resulting in the collection of approximately five tons of rubbish, including plastic, paper, carton and discarded food items, amongst other environmentally harmful material. Certificates of appreciation from Dubai Municipality and Dubai Police were handed over to Al-Futtaim Motors following the companys efforts.
Bertrand Thiebaut, Senior Managing Director of Al-Futtaim Motors, said: As the leader in sustainable mobility in the UAE, we felt that our duty was beyond just offering the widest range of hybrid vehicles in the country. We wanted our associates to physically contribute towards the preservation of the UAEs nature, so we can collectively give back to this beautiful country, helping it become more environmentally conscious, in line with the Governments agenda.
Through the Toyota and Lexus brands, Al-Futtaim Motors has established itself as the leader in sustainable mobility in the country, having witnessed consistent growth in its green journey over the past 6 years. During that time, Lexus has grown to becomes the largest provider of luxury hybrid vehicles in the UAE, offering vehicles such as the LS h, GS h, RX h and CT. In 2016, the United Arab Emirates joined the global environmental phenomena with the launch of the Toyota Prius, the worlds most popular hybrid car, in its efforts towards making the future of the UAE a more sustainable one.
Earlier this year, Al-Futtaim Motors announced a collaboration with Toyota Motor Corporation, Masdar, ADNOC, and Air Liquide to further study the possibilities for a hydrogen society in the UAE, by testing Toyotas zero-emission Fuel Cell technology through a number of hydrogen-powered Fuel Cell Toyota Mirai vehicles on the UAE roads.

Al-Futtaim Motors launches the UAEs first hybrid truck
In line with its efforts to make a significant difference in the environmental footprint and contribute to a cleaner air quality in the UAE, Al-Futtaim Motors, leader in sustainable mobility and exclusive distributor of Hino in the UAE, has launched the countrys first hybrid truck at the 8th edition of the Cold Food Chain Conference, which was held on the 5th of April the Meydan Hotel in Dubai.
The Hino 300 Series Hybrid light-duty truck features the worlds first hybrid diesel engine designed to deliver cleaner, more efficient transport solutions. Like the conventional petrol-engine Hino light-duty trucks, the hybrid variants are totally customizable and can be used with mounted chiller body, freezer body or dry cargo box, making them the ideal environmentally friendly transport solution for cold chain and cold storage services.
Ramez Hamdan, Acting Managing Director of Hino at Al-Futtaim Motors, said: We have seen significant growth in the volume of light-duty trucks in the past three years. This growth has been paralleled with serious environmental goals by the UAE Government, to which we have responded by introducing the 2017 Hino 300 Series Hybrid truck, the perfect sustainable commercial vehicle.
Its imperative for us to counteract the effects of harmful CO2 emissions, and our hybrid offering is a proven solution for the commercial sector with an impeccable track record worldwide, explained Hamdan.
By employing a diesel Hybrid system, using a Euro 4 and EVV compliant 4L diesel engine matched to an auxiliary electric motor that is emission-free, the Hino Hybrid drive system significantly reduces exhaust tailpipe emissions when compared to a conventional diesel-engine truck. The Hino Hybrid emits significantly reduced emissions of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, particulate matter and nitrogen oxide.
Hino Hybrid trucks also offer reduced running costs through greatly improved fuel economy and savings on maintenance costs, thanks to the myriad technologies available such as Idle stop, Regenerative braking, Easy Start and take-off assist, and Diesel particulate active reduction filter.
For more information about Hino Hybrid trucks, customers can visit any of the Hino 3S facilities (Sales, Spare parts and Service) in Dubai, Sharjah or Abu Dhabi, call 800 Hinosales (800 446672537) or check the full line-up at http://www.hino.ae/.

Intersect By Lexus, the award-winning dynamic eatery and cultural hub located at the heart of DIFC, will be hosting Lexus first ever Fuel Cell flagship concept, the Lexus LF-FC at its Garage, from April 21st until the end of August. Initially revealed at the Tokyo Motor Show 2015, the LF-FC flagship concept, is a visionary vehicle that offers a peek into the design and technology direction of the brands future flagship sedans, evoking inspiring emotions with its distinctive design that exceeds conventional imagination, automated driving technology and high-tech vision.
Intersect By Lexus is the ideal host platform for such an attractive and unique concept vehicle, embodying the future emotional design direction of Lexus, but perhaps the future of the automotive mobility as we know it, said Christopher Buxton, Managing Director of Lexus at Al-Futtaim Motors. The LF-FC concept is a translation of Lexus emotional design philosophy and amazing experiences. We are very proud to bring this concept vehicle to Intersect By Lexus, a space that projects creativity and design, giving our guests the opportunity to interact with the car in a relaxed and welcoming environment.
Intersect By Lexus, the two-story space launched in 2015, features an Eatery that offers a unique menu of artisanal crafted food on the first floor, a curated Library and a 500sq. ft. Garage on the lower floor, uniquely designed with over 150 hand-painted Lexus car parts covered with reinforced glass that holds the current concept car.
About the Lexus LF-FC Concept Vehicle
The LF-FC features a fresh new styling theme that embodies Lexus L-finesse design philosophy. From every angle, the sedan is aggressively elegant, exuding the spirit of a grand touring vehicle. An evolved version of Lexus signature grille with a new mesh design dominates the front, while floating L-shaped daytime running lights (DRL) extrude flawlessly from the front fenders. The rear is highlighted by striking new taillights that adopt the same floating theme as the DRL. When seen from its profile, the LF-FCs true character is revealed. The roofline flows from front to rear in the manner of a 4-door coupe, suggesting that this vehicle isnt just meant for straight highways, but to also be enjoyed on twisty roads. The sporty 21-inch aluminum wheels with carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) rims, add an extra dose of flair to what is already a dynamically styled machine.
The spacious interior of the LF-FC has been designed to wrap its occupants in a comfortable yet futuristic environment, while providing the driver with a highly-functional cockpit. The cabin has been designed in two sections, top and bottom. The top conveys a sense of openness, allowing the driver to concentrate on the road ahead without feeling constrained. When seen at eye level, the front seats seem to be floating. The rear seats have been designed for those who enjoy being driven, offering a reclining feature and plenty of head and knee space. High-quality aniline leather on the seats, doors and dashboard enhances the level of luxury of the interior.
Highlighting the new technology inside the LF-FC is an advanced human machine interface that can be operated by simple hand gestures, without the need to touch a panel or controls. A small holographic image on the center console indicates where the system can interpret your hand gestures to control the audio system and ventilation.
At the heart of the LF-FC is a high output fuel cell power system that energizes the rear wheels, and also sends power to two in-wheel motors in the front, making the LF-FC all-wheel-drive. This innovative drive system allows precise torque distribution control between the front and rear wheels, giving the full-size sedan exceptional dynamic handling and superior road stability. The strategic placement of the fuel-cell stack at the rear of the vehicle, power control unit at the front and T-formation configured hydrogen fuel tanks result in front and rear weight distribution optimal for a sporty sedan.
Using automated driving technologies, with elevated traffic environment recognition, prediction, and judgment function, the LF-FC provides a safe and efficient driving experience for its occupants and supports the vision of a world without traffic accidents.

PIXEL by Hiroto Yoshizoe wins the Lexus Design Award 2017
Lexus International has recently announced the Grand Prix winner of the Lexus Design Award 2017PIXEL by Hiroto Yoshizoeleading this prestigious international event to a peak of excitement. Lexus Design Award 2017 drew 1,152 entries from 63 countries under the theme of Yet.
The Lexus Design Award always presents a fascinating survey of the issues currently engaging young designers, and what they consider to be the most important challenges and compelling opportunities for design today. The quality and scale of ambition of the submissions to this years award program was truly exceptional. It was very difficult for us to whittle them all down to 12 finalists, then four prototype winners and finally to the Grand Prix winner, although every stage of the process generated a feisty and enjoyable debate, said Alice Rawsthorn, well-known design commentator and Lexus Design Award 2017 Judge.
Congratulating Hiroto Yoshizoe on his winning project, Takayuki Yoshitsugu, Chief Representative, Middle East and North Africa Representative Office, Toyota Motor Corporation, said, The Lexus Design Award was created with the aim of fostering the growth of ideas that contribute to society by supporting designers and creators whose works can help to shape a better future. This years winner  Hiroto Yoshizoes PIXEL  is a work of tremendous imagination and creativity that captures the essence of what the Lexus Design Award stands for.
Yoshitsugu continued, Design and craftsmanship have always been a fundamental part of the Lexus brand, and the Lexus Design Award attempts to extend this tradition to an exciting new direction. I would like to acknowledge the support we have received from our customers in the Middle East for our efforts towards shaping the future of design and using the power of creativity to build a better world.
Hiroto Yoshizoe commented, Im so surprised and honored to receive this prize from Lexus Design Award. I would like to thank Alex and Daniel of Snarkitecture for all their mentorship. I also offer my sincere thanks to all the people who have supported me on this project, and of course to Lexus for giving me this amazing opportunity.
First launched in 2013 to stimulate ideas for a better tomorrow, Lexus is celebrating the 5th anniversary of this international design competition which supports up-and-coming designers and creators worldwide.

Al-Futtaim Motors and Dubai Police one step closer to UAE Vision 2021s sustainability targets
Al-Futtaim Motors, exclusive distributor of Toyota, Lexus, Hino and Toyota Material Handling Equipment and leader in sustainable mobility in the UAE, have joined Dubai Police in reinforcing both organizations support for UAE Vision 2021s sustainable environment initiatives, by test driving Toyotas zero-emission Fuel Cell technology in the form of the hydrogen-powered Fuel Cell Toyota Mirai.
Al-Futtaim Motors also handed over the first Lexus ES 350 hybrid, which will help Dubai Police spread awareness of greener transport solutions, while aiding its efforts in more sustainable mobility.
Major General Abdullah Khalifa Al Merri, Commander-in-Chief of Dubai Police, said: The introduction of environmentally friendly vehicles into our patrol fleet is important as the Force aims to adopt more sustainable energy sources, including renewable energy, as well as reducing carbon emissions that are harmful to the environment.
The General HQ has developed many initiatives to protect natural environments, such as the planting of mangrove trees in the Ras Al Khor area, which has become a globally recognized nature reserve, as well as many initiatives to combat air pollution by reducing traffic congestion and introducing regulations for the maintenance of vehicles to reduce harmful emissions.
Other initiatives include combating marine pollution with new and advanced equipment and boats, in addition to the initiative of planting one million trees in Dubai, and the introduction of green vehicles cars to serve the employees and visitors at the General HQ, and introducing green vehicles to the Dubai Police fleet.
Unlike battery-powered electric vehicles, the four-door mid-size electric sedan with performance that fully competes with traditional internal combustion engines, Toyota Mirai, is not recharged by plugging it into an electricity grid, but creates electricity using hydrogen, enabling the car to run up to 500km+.
For more than seven years, Lexus has paved the path for hybrid transport in the UAE, and now offers the largest choice of hybrid vehicles to consumers and businesses, through Lexus LS, GS, RX, and CT. The Lexus ES has newly joined the fold in a pilot phase, reinforcing Al-Futtaim Motors position as leader in sustainable mobility, with concrete contribution to a cleaner and more sustainable motoring in the country.

Al-Futtaim Motors reiterates its environmental leadership in the UAE
Al-Futtaim Motors, leader in sustainable mobility and exclusive distributor of Toyota in the UAE, has handed over 127 Toyota vehicles to Sharjah Police, cementing the long-term partnership between the two entities. Al-Futtaim Motors also supported Sharjah Police in their plans to drive the UAE Vision 2021s sustainable environment initiatives, by test driving Toyotas zero-emission Fuel Cell technology in the form of the hydrogen-powered Fuel Cell Toyota Mirai.
Unlike battery-powered electric vehicles, Mirai, a hydrogen-powered Fuel Cell Electric vehicle, is driven by an electric motor, but instead of being powered by a battery, it creates electricity through an onboard Fuel Cell stack, using oxygen from the air with the stored hydrogen to power the car, resulting in the release of water instead of CO2 as a byproduct.
The handover, which took place at the Sharjah Police Headquarters, was attended by Saud Abbasi, Managing Director of Toyota at Al-Futtaim Motors, Yousuf Al Raeesi, Director of Government Affairs &Health, Safety, Security and Environment at Al-Futtaim Motors, as well as Brigadier Saif Al Zari Al Shamsi, General Commander of Sharjah Police, Brigadier Abdullah Mubarak bin Amer, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Sharjah Police, Brigadier Arif Mohammed Al Sharif, Director General of Human Resources and Support Services Department, Colonel Ali Rahma Al Owais, Director of Support Services Department among other senior officials from both bodies.
Al-Futtaim Motors has long enjoyed an excellent business relationship with Sharjah Police and today we are happy that were extending our partnership with the addition of a host of 127 Toyota vehicles to the Sharjah Police fleet. As the leading automotive distributor in the UAE, we pride ourselves on delivering not just Quality, Durability and Reliability, but also premium after sales services to our government partners, said Abbasi.
He detailed the many advantages of Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles (FCEV) compared to battery-powered electric cars, mainly in relation to fuel economy and driving range, fueling time and environmental impact.
The 127 vehicles include the powerful Prado, the bold new Camry, the expectations challenging Corolla, the versatile Hiace and the rugged and dominant Land Cruiser Pickup.

Al-Futtaim Motors supports UAEs environmental initiatives at Government Accelerators
Al-Futtaim Motors, exclusive distributor of Toyota, Lexus, Hino and Toyota Material Handling Equipment and leader in sustainable mobility in the UAE, has extended its support in the UAEs efforts to decrease emissions and its global environmental footprint at the Government Accelerators event, held on May 10th at the Emirates Towers.
The hydrogen-powered zero-emission Toyota Mirai Fuel Cell vehicle was displayed at the event, indicating Al-Futtaim Motors intentions to introduce efficient greener transport solutions, while aiding the government in more sustainable mobility, additionally, the vehicle has been test driven by H.E. Eng. Suhail Al Mazrouei, the UAEs Minister of Energy.
Yousuf Al Raeesi, Director of Government Affairs & Health, Safety, Security and Environment at Al-Futtaim Motors, said: We believe being part of this event is vital to educate the public on the future of green motoring, particularly in light of the clean air initiatives that the UAE government is implementing as part of its UAE Vision 2021 plan. As the leader in sustainable mobility in the UAE, Toyota has pioneered hybrid technology over 20 years ago and have sold more than 10 million hybrid vehicles globally. Most recently Toyota launched Mirai, the first zero-emission Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle (FCEV) which we are displaying here today, and which has seen interest from different government sectors across the UAE, given the zero impact this technology has on the driver and the environment.
We believe that the Fuel Cell Vehicle technology, when rolled out on a large scale, will be the most suitable environmental solution, offering zero emissions, driving range similar to traditional petrol vehicles (around 500km), and most importantly a hydrogen fuelling time of 3 to 5 minutes, very similar to traditional petrol engine fuelling, which means no change in the drivers behavior.aims to adopt more sustainable energy sources, including renewable energy, as well as reducing carbon emissions that are harmful to the environment.
Unlike battery-powered electric vehicles, the four-door mid-size electric sedan with performance that fully competes with traditional internal combustion engines, Toyota Mirai, is not recharged by plugging it into an electricity grid, but creates electricity using hydrogen, enabling the car to run up to 500km+.

Al-Futtaim Motors launches new Hino 500 Series in the UAE
Al-Futtaim Motors, leader in sustainable mobility and exclusive distributor of Hino in the UAE, has announced the launch of the redesigned medium duty Hino 500 Series truck, the companys second launch in a few months, following the introduction of the Hino 300 series hybrid.
Featuring a redesigned exterior, a host of enhanced safety features and driver comfort amenities, the 2017 Hino 500 Series continues to deliver on the companys promise of quality, durability and reliability, and is purpose-built to suit the needs of the local market to support customers businesses.
The latest generation of the Hino 500 Series trucks comes with a 7.7 L Euro 3 compliant engine equipped with a high pressure common rail fuel injection system and turbocharger/intercooler technology to achieve lower emissions and uncompromised power and fuel efficiency. The electronic control common rail technology in the engine allows it to maintain power and higher fuel economy performance under any driving condition.
Ramez Hamdan, General Manager of Hino at Al-Futtaim Motors, said: This year is proving very positive for Hino, as we continue to grow our market share and introduce new products that meet our customers needs. Just last month, we launched the UAEs first hybrid truck in the form of the Hino 300 Series hybrid, and the introduction of the Hino 500 Series allows us to offer a different solution to meet multiple sectors looking for a reliable truck that offers a host of advanced safety and driver comfort features. With companies increasingly aware of the need to reduce emissions and reliance on fossil fuels, the Hino 500 Series also maximizes efficiency and significantly reduces consumption thanks to class-leading engine and transmission choices.

Lexus unveils all-new LC luxury coupe to open a new chapter in brand history
The emotional designs and high-performance models issued by Lexus in the last few years prefaced a new chapter for the brand, one that begins now with the arrival of the all-new 2018 Lexus LC flagship performance coupe. Available now at Al-Futtaim Motors, leader in sustainable mobility and exclusive distributor of Lexus in the United Arab Emirates, the LC combines stunning design, scintillating performance, long-distance comfort and premium craftsmanship to join an elite group of international grand touring coupes.
The Lexus LC is a powerful, emotionally stirring realization of the vision of Lexus master driver Akio Toyoda for a flagship production coupe that echoes the spirit of the hand-built Lexus LFA supercar and delivers the visual impact of the Lexus LF-LC concept.
Christopher Buxton, Managing Director of Lexus at Al-Futtaim Motors, explained what the introduction of the LC 500 in the Lexus line-up means for the brand.
Lexus has a strong heritage in the UAE, having been here for more than 25 years, and for the past seven years, we have been leading the charge when it comes to luxury hybrid motoring, as we continue to strive for a greener environment and more sustainable mobility. The LC 500 employs a unique multi-stage hybrid system that not only achieves powerful performance, but also offers a smooth drive that embodies the promise of the Lexus marque, offering a pleasurable driving experience which enhances the users lifestyle.
Koji Sato, Chief Engineer of the Lexus LC, said: While maximizing the fundamental taste of the LF-LC, we applied completely different specifications to create a design that goes beyond the concept  a design that will captivate you as soon as you see it. In my view, pursuing beautiful design and elaborating superior performance are two very similar aspects. Beauty is the identity of Lexus design. Every feature of the LC is the result of an integrated approach to design and engineering. The entire team has worked together, including engineers and designers, to create such a great car.
The all-new Lexus LC is a flagship coupe which represents the evolution of Lexus as a lifestyle brand that will surprise and delight customers. The car symbolizes the beginning of a new phase for Lexus, which is all about creating greater synergy between engineering and design, said Takayuki Yoshitsugu, Chief Representative of Middle East and North Africa Representative Office, Toyota Motor Corporation. The LC makes the strongest statement yet about the brands future direction, and is the result of painstaking craftsmanship, attention to detail and an advanced, future-oriented approach to engineering. Its a car that offers a pleasurable driving experience which enhances the users lifestyle.
Yoshitsugu added, We are grateful to our customers in the GCC and Levant for their constant support and encouragement for our efforts to push the boundaries of automobile design and engineering, thus inspiring us to strive harder in creating ever-better cars. And we are confident the strong emotional appeal of the all-new Lexus LC will strike a chord with audiences in the region.
Provocative, elegant and purely Lexus
Based on the groundbreaking design of the LF-LC concept car which was shown at the 2012 North American International Auto Show (NAIAS) in Detroit, the Lexus LC debuted as a production model at the 2016 edition of NAIAS.
Turning the LF-LC concept into a production model while remaining faithful to its visual excitement required nothing less than a new development process, combining design and engineering disciplines as never before at Lexus. The production LC preserves the concepts adventurous appearance, and the design itself helped achieve performance targets, especially with regard to the low center of gravity, aerodynamics and high-speed stability. Just like its concept predecessor, which won the EyesOn Design award for Concept Car in 2012, the production LC is also a trophy winner, having claimed two awards at the 2016 EyesOn Design Awardsin the Production Car and Interior Design categories.
Emotional design that reinforces the Lexus identity
Tadao Mori, Chief Designer of the Lexus LC, said: This was one of the first times for Lexus that designers were closely involved in the dynamic engineering development, so we could understand the driving goals and support them with the cars design. The 2012 LF-LC concept model was the starting point, not our final goal. This means we didnt just duplicate LF-LCs surfaces and lines onto the production platform. Even though we decided to maintain LF-LCs design language and theme, we added more emotion. Id like to thank very much all the colleagues who were involved in the cars development at Lexus International.
Immediately identifiable as a Lexus thanks to its hallmark spindle grille and dynamic character lines, the 2018 LC represents the most passionate expression of the brands design direction. The grille itself features a unique mesh texture that changes visual tension as it spreads across the front of the car. Independent L-shaped daytime running lights beneath new ultra-compact triple LED headlamps create the distinctive LC front lighting signature. The combination of a large glass panel and blacked-out rear pillars creates a floating roof appearance, and chrome-plated moldings along the edges, which echo the lines of a traditional Japanese sword, amplify the effect.
The bodys substantial, planted look stems from prominent quarter panels that flare away from the center of the car and door panels that are pulled inward. The flowing lines maintain a consistent tension in the body panels through to the rear, where very slim tail lamps use mirrors to create a three-dimensional sequence of L-shaped graphics. The sweeping roofline tapers rearward between muscular, sloping fender tops, underscoring the cars wide and stable stance, and the Lexus spindle shape is repeated in the rear fascia. Large ducts feed air into the rear wheel arches, the airstream exiting smoothly across the tire sidewall to bolster straight-line stability and steering responsiveness.
The all-new Lexus LC is available in vibrant colors including two newly-developed Naples Yellow Contrast Layering and Structural Blue, which accentuates the cars sportiness with the realization of a high intensity yellow for the exterior panels. *Available from Dec17.
High-output V8 with sound and fury
Powered by a high-performance V8 engine, the all-new Lexus LC 500 exhales through the variable Active Exhaust upon startup, with the 5-liter naturally aspirated V8 issuing a clarion call to driving enthusiasts. The LC 500 can sprint from zero to 100 km in less than 4.7 seconds. Its a well-proven performance engine, with a low-mass reciprocating assembly using lightweight forged connecting rods, along with titanium intake and exhaust valves to allow a 7,300-rpm redline. The 32-valve cylinder heads, equipped with performance-tuned VVT-iE (Variable Valve Timing-intelligent by electric motor), take full advantage of the engines low internal friction and aggressive valvetrain specs.
The D-4S injection system uses direct fuel injection that allows a high compression ratio augmented by port fuel injectors to enhance low-speed response. Under acceleration, the LC 500 reveals its character in a continuously rising power curve, with the 471 hp developed at 7,100 rpm and the torque peak of 55.0 kg-m at 4,800 rpm.
The fast-revving V8 issues a stunning soundtrack amplified by a special resonance tube connecting the intake to the firewall, plus a standard Active Exhaust that rumbles and roars like a high-performance GT should. Lexus considers the sound of the engine to be an important contributor to delivering a genuinely multi-sensory driving pleasure. And in the new LC 500, the company has taken great steps to achieve truly emotional engine sound, where Lexus engineers have worked to combine the sounds produced both by the air intake system at the front and the exhaust system at the rear to create what they describe as a concert hall effect inside the cabin, both as the car gains speed and slows down. The sound has been developed specifically for the LC, to reflect the coupes specific performance qualities. The driver can adjust the natural exhaust sound level via the Drive Mode Select system.
The Lexus LC debuts the first 10-speed automatic transmission for a luxury automobile. Smaller and lighter than some 8-speed units, this new transmission executes shifts at speeds rivaling dual-clutch transmissions, yet with the seamless performance and smoothness of a torque converter automatic. The LC allows manual shifting via magnesium paddles.
Even drivers who pride themselves on making expertly timed shifts, however, will find the advanced electronic control system which anticipates the drivers inputs by monitoring acceleration, braking and lateral-g forces  always chooses the ideal ratio. Torque converter lock-up engages in all ranges except when starting off to provide a direct feel and also aid fuel efficiency.
The Drive Mode Select feature provides integrated control of multiple systems, offering enhanced driving pleasure by allowing the driver to select drive modes suitable for the situation, or to match their preferred driving style. In addition to the five drive modes set in advance, a Custom Mode has been provided, enabling the user to freely combine each mode. SPORT S+ extracts the most from the powertrain and transmission shifts and also fully opens the baffles in the Active Exhaust under acceleration.
The V8 is a good citizen, too, switching to the Atkinson cycle to enhance fuel efficiency at cruising speeds and Otto cycle for higher performance levels when accelerating, thus providing the perfect mix of power and efficiency.
The next-generation hybrid
Lexus, which introduced the worlds first luxury hybrid 13 years ago, developed a new Multi Stage Hybrid System specifically for the LC 500h. Like other Lexus hybrid configurations, the Multi Stage Hybrid System teams the gasoline engine with two electric motors/generators, but similarities end there. The Atkinson-cycle 3.5-liter V6 gasoline engine uses D-4S direct fuel injection, and lightweight valvetrain components allow a 6,600-rpm redline, with Dual VVT-i ensuring ample torque across the engine speed range.
The Multi Stage Hybrid System is a worlds first construction that combines the Lexus hybrid system with variable gears. By controlling the output of both the higher rpm 3.5-liter V6 engine and the electric motor, it achieves powerful performance from low speeds through to high range driving. In addition, operating points were selected for high system efficiency from low through to high speeds and the sphere of Electric Vehicle (EV) performance has been enlarged. Altogether, these helped to deliver an emotive driving experience, superior fuel efficiency, and comfortable cruising. The Multi Stage Hybrid System also allows for more electric assist at lower vehicle speeds, and it enables the LC 500h to operate with the gasoline engine off at speeds of up to 140 km/h.
The combined system output is 354 hp, yet that figure does not fully indicate the LC 500hs performance potential. The LC uses an advanced Drivers Mind Index (DMI) control to understand the drivers intentions which helps to optimize gear selection. The power generated from the engine and the motor is rapidly and accurately sent to the tires, providing for a high-performance engine rpm and acceleration in accordance with the drivers intentions. When driving along winding roads, the car changes to a lower gear, and proceeds to actively downshift when braking. On the other hand, during more challenging sports driving, the battery provides additional output so as to achieve a greater torque sensation, thus providing an emotional driving experience that will change the way hybrids have been perceived.
Thanks to the Multi Stage Hybrid Systems design, the driver is also able to take advantage of an M mode to select and hold gears manually, using paddle shifts mounted behind the steering wheel. The coordinated control of the Power Split Device and the gear shifting mechanism ensures the gear shift will start instantaneously with the computer receiving the signal from the paddle shift, giving an exceptionally quick response.
Chief Engineer Koji Sato explained: In the past, people only associated hybrid with eco. We wanted to broaden that perception and create a true high-performance powertrain.
The LC is the first Lexus hybrid to use a compact, lightweight lithium-ion battery. The battery pack fits neatly between the rear seats and the luggage compartment and has a high-power density, with its 84 cells producing 310.8 volts.
A chassis with sports car moves
Built on the new Lexus Global Architecture  Luxury (GA-L) platform, the LC harmonizes driving performance, design and craftsmanship in unprecedented ways to achieve a new sense of ingenuity.
Achieving sports car handling with a high degree of ride comfort, while maintaining the low hood height, was a particularly demanding challenge. The solution was a double ball joint front suspension that allows for control of the smallest movements from driver inputs and the road surface, yielding more precise steering response with better initial effort. The LC driver will feel the effectiveness of the suspension design in the immediate response at initial turn-in, controlled body motion and precise, linear response that create a rhythmical and smooth driving experience. The LCs electric power steering (EPS) gives a natural feel, while yielding high handling precision.
The LC exhibits razor-sharp reflexes, exceptional handling balance and rock-solid stability. Rock solid could also describe the stiffest unibody Lexus has ever produced. The strategic use of lightweight, high-strength steels yields a structure that is resistant to twisting forces. The combination of high-strength steels, aluminum and CFRP, along with deleting a spare tire in favor of run-flat tires and moving the 12v battery to the trunk area, helps yield 52:48 weight distribution (LC 500h). The LC engineers followed an inertia spec to locate as much mass as possible toward the center and lower in the chassis to improve the center of gravity. The low center of gravity also enabled Lexus to reduce the LCs roll angle without making the suspension too stiff, which would hurt ride comfort.
The increased lateral stiffness of the run-flat tires complements the LCs highly rigid suspension, while reduced vertical stiffness aids ride comfort. The high-performance braking system employs 6-piston front brake calipers and 4-piston rear calipers. The LC is available with 21-inch forged alloy wheels that offer a lightweight design, black-and-chrome coating and a polished finish.
A new benchmark for GT cabins
The dynamic luxury theme of the exterior is carried through into the LCs cabin, which brings together elegance, quality and sophistication with a driver-focused cockpit. The ideal grand touring coupe cabin must strike a balance between function and comfort, sporting intent and luxury. The Lexus LC hits that note with an intuitive layout and an optimal seating position that set the stage for spirited driving. The design places the drivers hip point as close as possible to the cars center of gravity, where feedback from the car is the most communicative to the driver.
The low instrument panel position, together with the low hood line and narrow A pillars, give the low-seated driver a commanding view of the road. All driving controls are easy to reach without altering ones posture. Lexus positioned the information displays at the same height, to reduce the degree of eye movement required to read them. The instrument binnacle houses the latest version of the TFT display technology introduced in the Lexus LFA supercar, including a moving central ring.
Comfort and luxury are no less thorough. The LCs exclusive seats feel as good as they look, with a new two-part construction technique where the main part of the seatback drapes over the shoulder area and then wraps around the seatback. Bolsters in the shoulder area help hold the driver securely in cornering maneuvers, and the optional sports seats feature even more substantial bolsters.
The steering wheel cross section changes around its circumference to allow for variations in grip and twisting of the wrist, and large, substantial feeling magnesium alloy paddle shifters are easily hooked by the fingertips. The front passenger has not been ignored; the side of the center console rises to form an integrated grab handle. With function, there is also beauty and impeccable craftsmanship. The flowing lines of the door panels serve as an extension of an exterior line that flows from the hood and through the windshield to build a sense of continuity between the exterior and interior.
The Lexus LC comes in four distinctive interior color schemes that include new Breezy Blue* and Ocher, together with Dark Rose and Black seen in other Lexus models. The quality and finish of the upholstery, trim materials and detailing reflect the Takumi craftsmanship and fine attention to detail for which Lexus is renowned. It can be seen and felt in the hand stitching of the leather-wrapped gearshift lever and the draping treatment of the Alcantara door panel trim, among numerous other details.
*Available from Dec17 on LC Hybrid.
The Lexus LC cockpit artfully integrates the brands latest audio, navigation and connectivity technologies, making them easily accessible. The new Lexus multimedia package combines an inviting graphic user interface with software that enables future enhancements, and the center console features the latest-generation Remote Touch Interface touchpad control, with quick and intuitive operation.
As thrilling as the LC sounds from the outside, Lexus also ensured that sounds inside the cabin would delight those with a fine ear for musical detail. Lexus has enjoyed an auto industry-exclusive partnership with Mark Levinson since 2001, giving its customers the benefit of bespoke audio systems of the highest quality in its vehicles. The new LC follows in this tradition, offering Mark Levinson audio systems with exclusive equipment from their top-of-the-range Reference Product. The 13-speaker audio system uses innovative technologies to deliver concert hall quality sound.
The LCs Mark Levinson audio system also features Clari-Fi music restoration technology that enhances music playback by automatically analyzing and improving the quality of all types of compressed, digitized music sources. It identifies music signals that have been compressed and restores them in real time during playback to achieve an accurate and full listening experience.
Comprehensive suite of safety technologies
Both versions of the LC are equipped as standard with Lexus Safety System+, an array of active safety features that can help the driver avoid an accident, or help lessen the consequences of a collision. The system uses a camera and millimeter-wave radar to monitor the road ahead for potential hazards and collision risks.
The package includes advanced driver assistance functions such as Pre-Crash System (PCS), a combination of collision detection and collision preparation systems; Dynamic Radar Cruise Control System (DRCC), which supplements the conventional system with a vehicle-to-vehicle distance control mode that helps maintain a suitable distance from the preceding vehicle; Lane-Keeping Assist (LKA), which uses a camera sensor located in the upper windshield area to detect lane markings while driving and then provides the driver with information and steering assistance in accordance with road and driving conditions; and Automatic High Beam (AHB), which detects nearby light sources such as the headlights or tail lights of vehicles ahead and automatically switches between high beams and low beams to ensure optimum nighttime visibility.
Other safety features on the LC include Lexus Parking Assist (LPA), which makes use of a sensor to notify the driver by display and buzzer of the approximate distance between the vehicle and an obstacle; Rear Cross Traffic Alert (RCTA) system, designed to help prevent potential danger in parking situations; Blind Spot Monitor, which detects and warns the driver of vehicles approaching or positioned in the adjacent lanes; Vehicle Stability Control (VSC), which helps prevent side skids and also to stabilize the vehicle while turning on a curve; as well as Anti-lock Braking System (ABS).

The Middle East is a very important and strategic region for us, with more than 60 stores across 9 countries, including all the new strategic initiatives we have put in place. I am very excited about the future developments in this region.
The glamorous celebration also saw the unveiling of the brands latest campaign, featuring GUESS girl, Hailey Baldwin. Directed by Paul Marciano, co-founder and Chief Creative Officer of GUESS, the campaign perfectly reflects GUESS all American style and rich denim heritage that has characterized the brand for the past 35 years.
GUESS is one of the most iconic denim brands, and we are pleased to be long-term partners in the Middle East region, commented Neil Lowe, General Manager, Al-Futtaim Premium Fashion Division, MENA. It is an honour to be part of the 35 year anniversary celebrations, and we look forward to seeing the brand reach even more success in the coming years.
The spectacular event kicked off with a catwalk showcase unveiling GUESS Spring-Summer 2017 collection, featuring carefree feminine wear and tropical mens details. The catwalk brought to life the true essence of the brand, with romantic silhouettes, colourful Caribbean patterns and GUESS iconic denim pieces. The GUESS anniversary celebrations continued with an exciting set by DJ Lins and exclusive displays of the new collection pieces, including the limited-edition Originals 1981 anniversary capsule collection, and previews of the GUESS campaign videos.
Founded by the Marciano brothers 35 years ago, GUESS transformed unfashionable denim workwear into a timeless wardrobe essential, thanks to the brands innovative and creative outlook on timeless styles. Now, 35 years later, GUESS is seen as a major name in the fashion industry, with an unwavering expertise in bringing to life the latest trends, while still staying true to the brand identity.

French Fashion label La Fee Maraboutee known for its ultra-feminine originality and quality marks its entry into the Middle East as it launches its exclusive collection at the Middle Easts oasis of inspiration Robinsons in Dubai Festival City.
Jean-Pierre Braillard the creative visionary behind the brand wanted to create fashionable items for the modern woman in search of style and practicality. The labels feminine, every-day-pieces made of sumptuous fabrics have already elicited an enthusiastic response from the citys internationally-exposed fashionistas.
La Fe Maraboute uses the softest and most natural fabrics such as cotton, linen, viscose, wool, cashmere and angora and combines French design and Italian craftsmanship thus guaranteeing quality. Women across the Middle East are known for their attention to detail and elegant sense of style. I knew it was the right time for La Fee Maraboutee to be part of the Middle Eastern fashion landscape and I am looking forward to developing the brands presence throughout the Middle East, said JeanPierre Braillard.
Taking inspiration from Parisian boutiques, the space in Robinsons will feature womens apparel, shoes, handbags, and accessories. The space is a fun mix of bohemian style, refined elegance and playful prints with a relaxed and warm vibe.

This year, for Ramadan, GUESS is launching a special capsule collection exuding femininity and style. Specifically targeted at Middle Eastern customers, the pieces have been designed with meticulous attention to detail and finishes, offering a selection of subtly chic and sophisticated outfits for daytime and eveningwear.
Long, flowing dresses and kaftans are enriched with precious lace, embroideries and flounces, adding a graceful touch of romanticism, while pastel flowers blossom in all-over prints, on soft, fluid fabrics. For special occasions, gold accents steal the show on striking dresses and enveloping skirts.
Children too are given ample opportunity to shine with the elegant outfits of the special GUESS Kids Ramadan line. Girls skirts and dresses feature a touch of bling, with sequins, rhinestones and iridescent pearl necklines, punctuating precious fabrics such as organdie, lace and macram. Boys are decked out as miniature gentlemen in stylish stretch satin blazers, waistcoats and Bermuda shorts, paired with poplin shirts and a charming stretch satin bowtie.
The exclusive collection will be available from mid-May in all GUESS stores across the Middle East.

The new Stockholm collection, from the Swedish home furnishing retailer IKEA, is all about the beauty of doing things at the right pace. It is a collection of furniture and home accessories using natural material that have taken their time to come to life.
The first Stockholm collection was launched in 1984. Each new collection is different from previous ones, but they all share some common characteristics: Scandinavian modernity of the highest quality in form, function and materials  but at an affordable price.
As a carefully curated collection of 47 pieces, made from natural and tactile materials such as rattan, hand-blown glass and ash, it is designed to mix and blend with what is already at home and been made to use and enjoy, every day.
While working on the Stockholm collection, IKEA conducted a survey in November 2016 to know how people think and feel about time wellbeing and the other topics that inspired the collection. More than 10,000 people in Sweden, Italy, Germany, China and the U.S. participated. The below headlines were introduced;
54% feel that a harmonic, homely house makes it easier to relax 49% would like to spend more time outside, in nature 23% think that being constantly digitally connected increases stress 48% care about balance of the soul and wellbeing 33% think that wellness means consciously slowing down and recharging 32% believe that if you decelerate your life, your quality of life improves 36% would like to take more time for things in daily their daily lives 34% think handmade products are higher in quality 41% want to know where the goods they buy are manufactured 34% would like to live more sustainably

For the first time, two Al-Futtaim brands have come together in one location and in one store. Plug Ins has opened its latest new store inside Al-Futtaim ACE at Yas Mall, where everything that customers need for their home is now available as a single offering. Following extensive study, the project was designed to provide customers a seamless shopping experience which allows them focus on personal areas of interest and styles.
Sean Connor, Managing Director, Al-Futtaim Electronics said: We are pleased to announce the much awaited opening of our Plug Ins store within Al-Futtaim ACE. This partnership signifies our vision to bring two Al-Futtaim brands together and represents a great opportunity for each Al-Futtaim brand, and moreover is a complimentary proposition for our customers, who can now enjoy the convenience of many more home products on offer under one roof.
The co-branding proposition was always thought to be beneficial, and the early signs of trade show that it is a good fit. Riding on back of its success, we can look at opening more joint branded stores which we deem to be mutually beneficial to both brands, Sean continued.
The e-commerce channel is also promoted through this store, giving customers access to even more extensive offerings online via dedicated terminals, complemented by the on-hand expertise of the Plug Ins sales team.

Dallas-based Super Chix is expanding its wildly popular restaurant concept to the Middle East through an exclusive partnership with Al-Futtaim. Originally developed by Yum! Brands and with multiple restaurants already open in Texas in the USA, the brand has exported its unique offering to the Middle East, with the first Super Chix in the UAE now open at Riverland, Dubai Parks and Resorts.
Paul Delaoutre, President of Al-Futtaim Retail said: Al-Futtaim recently launched its Food & Beverage division and has been looking for inspiring brands from across the world to bring to the Middle East. After an exhaustive search for a premium chicken brand that included both big and small concepts, it became clear that Super Chix would fit perfectly within our portfolio. This new restaurant concept is sure to drive a lot of interest.
Kieran Mallon, General Manager, Food & Beverage, Al-Futtaim Retail, commented: Super Chix is very popular in its home state of Dallas and we are confident that it will enjoy the same success here in Dubai. Our common long term goal is to offer a high-quality food experience to all chicken fans, not only in the UAE but also in other countries across the region as part of our expansion plans.
Already feeding and delighting a huge fan base in the USA, the classed-up chicken joints menu offers a mouth-watering selection of chicken sandwiches and tenders, hand cut fries and fresh salads. There is also a whole range of delicious frozen custard for those looking for the perfect dessert.

A drawing of a fluffy lion by seven-year old Shane Mathew, who lives in the UAE with his parents, is among 10 designs selected by IKEA from thousands of global submissions. These designs will be transformed into soft toys as part of IKEAs Lets Play for Change Campaign. The initiative supports childrens right to play and develop across the globe.
This is the third year that IKEA invited children from around the world to draw their own imaginary creatures that are turned into actual soft toys which go on sale in IKEA stores across the globe.
The winners were chosen from more than 70,000 drawings submitted globally by children aged 12 or under. In the UAE, the Swedish home furniture retailer, part of Al-Futtaim, received over 905 submissions.
Shanes winning drawing was inspired by the Cowardly Lion from the Wizard of Oz, one of his favorite bedtime stories. The seven-year old who is enrolled in grade two at Gems Founders School, Dubai, loves science but he is also passionate about drama, arts and craft. Shane, who has been described by his parents as a very active child who makes friends easily dreams to become a scientist when he grows up and to create his own inventions.
We would like to congratulate Shane, and thank all the young participants for their unique and creative ideas. We are proud to have a winner selected from the UAE and are grateful to have contributed towards this global initiative. said John Kersten, Managing Director  IKEA UAE, Qatar, Egypt and Oman.
The announcement of the Dubai winner has been received with great enthusiasm by IKEA representatives in the UAE who are planning a small celebration for Shane in the IKEA store in Dubai Festival City to recognise his achievement.
Bodil Fritjofsson, Product Developer in Childrens IKEA, commented on the success of the campaign: The amount of drawings we received is overwhelming! The world will not lack potential future artists and designers, some of the drawings are real pieces of art. The event creates opportunities for children to be creative and get to draw their dream toy and that opens up their fantasy, which really shows in the art. They really draw from their own head and dont copy from something.
Shanes Fluffy Lion was described by Bodil Fritjofsson as: A fluffy, happy cartoonlike lion, looking like hes saying Im on fire, ready for any adventure, but he wont eat you. Big soft nice feet.
The chosen drawings, including the one designed by Shane, will become a special limited soft toy collection, to be launched in IKEA stores worldwide as part of their Lets Play for Change Campaign. For each soft toy sold globally, the IKEA Foundation will donate EUR 1 to organisations that support children in need such as Save the Children and UNICEF. Since 2003, the Soft Toys for Education campaign, coordinated by the IKEA Foundation, has raised EUR 88 million and has helped more than 12 million children from 46 countries to get access to a better education.

Eight-year old Egyptian girl wins IKEA 'Soft Toys for Education' competition
FEBRUARY 23, 2016
An eight-year old girl, Salma from Cairo, Egypt has won IKEAs global drawing competition for children. A total of 55,000 children participated in IKEAs Good Cause campaign to design their dream toy. In return, IKEA will reward the top 10 winners by developing their drawings into real soft toys to be sold in its stores globally.
Salmas winning drawing was a yellow bird which was described as clear and direct oozes of the childs imagination. She heard about the competition from her mother and decided to participate, since drawing and colouring are her favourite hobbies.
The top 10 winners of the competition, launched in November 2015, also included children aged from five to nine from Thailand, Indonesia, Spain, Hong Kong, Czech Republic, Finland, France, Turkey and, Canada, as well as Egypt.
In collaboration with UNICEF, this is the second year that children from around the world have participated in creating IKEAs new soft toy collection for its Good Cause campaign, which focuses on childrens right to play. For every soft toy sold during the campaign, IKEA Foundation will donate one Euro to childrens education projects through UNICEF and Save the Children programme.
For many children, soft toys are a comfort, a best friend and a sense of security. Not only do we want to inspire young children and encourage creativity, we also want to trigger compassion within our consumers and their children to inspire them to support social responsibility throughout their lives. The amount of designs we received is overwhelming! The creativity is universal, and children in all countries seem to be inspired by similar things: dinosaurs, birds and monsters. The personalities are really strong with their winking eyes, feet that go in both directions and wonderful combinations of features. They really draw from their own head and do not copy from elsewhere, said Adosh Sharma, Country Manager, IKEA Egypt.
Over 10 million children have benefited from the Soft Toys for Education campaign since it was launched in 2003. Over the last ten years, the campaign supported over 90 projects in 46 countries and raised 57 million Euros, and 9.3 million Euros in 2012 alone. These funds are used in improving school infrastructures, access to water and sanitation facilities, training teachers, and providing school benches, desks and educational supplies.

Al-Futtaim Automall to open UAE's biggest used car site
MAY 29, 2017 Customers in the UAE looking for used cars will have a new destination with the opening of the UAEs biggest site at Dubai Festival City. Al-Futtaim Automall, the largest retailer of pre-owned vehicles in the UAE, has announced it will open a new 12,000 sqm super site next month.
Located opposite IKEA and alongside ACE, the new location will accommodate over 400 cars from popular brands including Nissan, Toyota, Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Dodge, Ford, Mitsubishi, Chevrolet, Jeep and more. Leading luxury brands will also be represented with models from BMW, Mercedes, Lexus, Volvo, Infiniti, Jaguar, Land Rover and Porsche amongst others.
Declan McCluskey, Managing Director of Automall, said: At Automall, we put our customers at the heart of everything we do. It is part and parcel of our DNA. The new showroom, once open, will offer the widest range of pre-owned vehicles from the worlds leading brands all under one roof.
Automall is already possibly the biggest used car brand in the UAE with over 1,000 cars on offer across our outlets, and which are also displayed on our website. But with this new location we will be able to offer an even bigger and better choice to our customers, added Mr. McCluskey.
Commenting on the growth of the business, Mr. McCluskey said: In recent years, we have seen consistently strong demand for used cars, with a small growth of 3% across our existing operations between 2015 and 2016. That growth has continued into this year and our expectations are for a further 10% increase across our existing sites. The new operation at DFC offers a wider range of cars and we expect will increase our sales volumes even further.
Automall sells cars that are under five years old and that have driven no more than 75,000kms. Each vehicle goes through a comprehensive 99-point check and is fully prepared to its high standards before being offered for sale. In addition, each vehicle benefits from a comprehensive Automall warranty for additional security and peace of mind for the customer.
Besides having models that fit various budgets, all cars sold through Automall have been stringently checked and prepared prior to sale, said Graeme Sears, Operations Director for Al-Futtaim Automall. Buying a used car can be challenging as you may not be certain of a vehicles condition or history. Here at Automall, we set out to take away those fears by offering customers the opportunity to buy cars that had been fully checked and approved by our team of trained experts, he added.
For more information, please call 600 567 005 or visit www.automalluae.com which offers easy access to the vehicles available with comprehensive search options and multiple pictures of the actual cars for sale.

Al-Futtaim Honda launches the completely redesigned and re-engineered all-new CR-V
JUNE 4, 2017 Al-Futtaim Honda, the exclusive distributor of Honda vehicles in the UAE, has announced the launch of the all-new Honda CR-V across all its showrooms in the UAE.
Now in its 5th generation, the completely redesigned and re-engineered CR-V boasts a bold new styling, premium interior and a host of new features and technologies aimed at enhancing CR-Vs status as the outright benchmark in the highly popular compact SUV segment.
Colin Cordery, Regional Managing Director of Al-Futtaim Honda said: The Honda CR-V is one of our popular models and we are extremely pleased to launch the new model here the UAE. Compared to the previous generation, the all-new CR-V raises the bar with a major update both interior and exterior. Customers will find the new CR-V offers the highest levels of comfort, performance and driving experience and is great value for money. We encourage all our customers to take one out for a test drive to truly experience this amazing vehicle.
The new CR-V targets the highest levels of quality and driving refinement in its class with top class steering precision, ride comfort, body control and cabin quietness.
The all-new CR-V comes in four grades: LX and LX Plus in 2-wheel drive (2WD) and EX Plus and Touring in all-wheel drive (AWD).
New powertrain and chassis technology
At the heart of the all-new CR-V is a 2.4-litre DOHC, direct injected i-VTEC engine that is mated to a smooth shifting and sporty continuously variable transmission (CVT) with Honda G-Shift control logic.
The 2.4-liter engine generates 184-horsepower @ 6400rpm and a torque of 244NM @ 3900rpm. The fuel consumption statistics of the CR-V are 15.5km/L for the LX and LX Plus grades and 14.7km/L for the EX Plus and Touring grades.
The all-new body and chassis design in the CR-V provide more agile and confident handling, greater drive refinement and superior overall versatility. Its front MacPherson strut and rear multi-link suspension utilise specially tuned low-friction dampers, with both front wheel drive (FWD) and AWD models including tubular front and solid rear stabiliser bars that promote quick turn-in and flatter cornering. Dual-pinion, variable ratio Electric Power Steering (EPS) also contributes to the CR-Vs direct and satisfying steering feel.
Bold and sophisticated exterior styling
The CR-V heads in a new fresh direction with crisper and sharper front-end design elements such as the new aggressively styled headlights surrounded by wing-shaped LED Day Time Running Lights (DRL) array on all grades.
The CR-Vs new windswept front-end appearance also includes signature Honda LED headlights (on the Touring only). Wide muscular fenders with athletic wheel arches, longer wheelbase and short rear overhang give the new CR-V a more sophisticated and athletic presence. Perfectly straddling the line between bold design and modern sophistication, this is the perfect SUV for any lifestyle.
The new CR-V also features distinct LED taillights and exciting wheel options in 17 inches (LX and LX Plus grades) and 18 inches (EX Plus and Touring grades) that help it stand out from the crowd. It also includes a Power Programmable Tailgate, which opens and closes at the push of a button with added tailgate height-adjustability feature (available on Touring grade only) which can be customised for drivers of all heights. Other notable standard features include power door mirrors, side mirror LED indicators, rear fog lights, headlight off timer, various chrome garnishes and auto rain sensing wipers (Touring only).
Premium, spacious and technologically advanced interior styling
The new CR-V raises the bar for interior refinement and utility through its completely redesigned cockpit and innovative premium features.
The more spacious cabin, with top-in-class interior space and the best rear seat legroom in its class, features upgraded materials throughout, including a new soft-touch instrument panel and more intricately stitched seats. A colour TFT driver information interface (DII) centre meter display adds to the handsome new design aesthetic.
With the new easy fold down and 60/40 split rear seat design, the CR-Vs interior is incredibly versatile with room for five people and a substantial amount of cargo of various sizes.
The CR-V offers the latest in vehicle connectivity and audio performance with a new generation of advanced technologies.
The 7-inch touchscreen Display Audio is compatible with Apple CarPlayTM and AndroidAutoTM platforms, giving customers seamless integration of key smartphone features and functions, including smartphone powered GPS navigation and voice controlled search capabilities.
The clean and elegantly laid out dashboard presents advanced driving technology placing essential information directly in the line of sight. The DII supplies a wide range of information such as average fuel consumption, AWD torque identification, turn-by-turn navigation and Driver Attention Monitor. The Driver Attention Monitor is designed to detect driver fatigue and alert the driver when exhibiting diminished attention to the road with a series of visual and audio alerts.
The Honda LANEWATCHTM feature in EX Plus and Touring grades uses a camera located in the passenger door mirror to display a clear image of the lanes and any vehicles that are in the lane on the 7-inch Display Audio screen. The Multi-Angle Rearview Camera with dynamic guidelines shows steering input direction, to ensure you park safely and quickly.
Some of the key comfort and convenience features available on the new CR-V include a smart entry and remote engine start (LX Plus, EX Plus and Touring only), single zone air conditioning in LX and dual-zone climate controls in the remaining grades, rear A/C ducts in all grades, Auto Dimming Rear View Mirror (EX Plus and Touring only), Electronic Parking Brake (EPB) with Brake Hold function, front USB ports, rear 2.5A USB charging ports and front passenger seat with 4-way power adjustment and drivers seat with 8-way power adjustment and 4-way power lumbar support.
Advanced safety
The all-new CR-V uses Hondas next-generation Advanced Compatibility Engineering (ACE) body structure. The CR-V targets the highest available collision safety ratings, including an NCAP 5-star Overall Vehicle Score from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and a TOP SAFETY PICK+ rating from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS).
The new CR-V utilises an Electronic Brake Booster (EBB), which replaces the conventional vacuum Brake Booster. The EBB motor is controlled by a microprocessor that monitors the vehicle speed as well as the pressure the driver applies to the brake pedal, building superior hydraulic pressure more quickly and with less pedal effort in all braking situations.
Other Honda active safety features include Vehicle Stability Assist (VSA) with Traction Control Systems (TCS), Anti-Lock Brake Systems (ABS), Electronic Brake Distributor (EBD), Agile Handling Assist, Tire Pressure Monitor System (TPMS), Brake Over-Ride System and Hill Start Assist (HSA). Rear Parking Sensors are present in LX Plus, EX Plus and Touring grades.

The all-new CR-V comes in the below exterior and interior colours for all grades:
Exterior Colours
 White Diamond Pearl
 Lunar Silver Metallic
 Modern Silver Metallic
 Crystal Black Pearl
 Basque Red Pearl
 Dark Olive Metallic
 Obsidian Blue Pearl
 Sandstorm Metallic
 Gun Metal Metallic

The new CR-V comes with 5 years unlimited mileage warranty as standard.
The all-new CR-V starts at AED 89,900 for the LX model, AED 99,900 for the LX Plus model, AED 113,900 for the EX Plus and AED 125,900 for the top-grade Touring.

Lexus LC 500 takes three-in-a-row 2017 SUPER GT500 victory
JUNE 20, 2017 Having dominated the first two rounds of the 2017 AUTOBACS SUPER GT500 series in Okayama and Fuji Speedway, the new Lexus LC 500 displayed its prowess once again at the Autopolis racing circuit to make it three wins in a row. This time, it was the turn of the #36 au TOMS LC 500 driven by Kazuki Nakajima and James Rossiter to keep the Lexus flag flying as they raced to victory in the third round of the championship.
In a race held under clear bright skies and fought over a challenging 300-km distance, the au TOMS LC 500 battled its way from seventh on the grid to the top step of the podium to continue Lexus scintillating start to the season and consolidate the teams position on top of the manufacturers standings.
This has been another excellent performance from the team, and I congratulate au TOMS LC 500 for maintaining Lexus dominance in the 2017 season, said Takayuki Yoshitsugu, Chief Representative, Middle East and North Africa Representative Office, Toyota Motor Corporation. Participating in motorsports events allows us to gather a variety of data which in turn help us while developing production vehicles. The level of support we received from our fans has been one of the highlights of our 2017 activities so far, and I express my gratitude to them for their constant encouragement of our motorsports initiatives.
The SUPER GT qualifying employs a unique two-stage knockout format, meaning both drivers of each team must be quick enough to get into higher position. Everyone makes a desperate attempt to clock the fastest lap in qualifying within the given time limit to get a better position at the actual race, making it a breathtaking battle well worth watching.
Besides, since races tend to get boring if a single car dominates the season, weight handicaps (success ballast), which are calculated according to accumulated points the drivers have acquired in all previous races, are assigned to the cars in the next race. Heavier cars have poorer acceleration and braking, meaning the championship battle is expected to go down to the wire. That looked to be a real disadvantage initially, since Lexus teams dominated the previous two rounds and this meant the LC 500 cars had to carry extra weight into the race. Despite the weight handicap, five of the six Lexus LC 500s made it through to the second stage of qualifying.
As the race started, the pole-starting competitor car secured the fastest lap of the entire race on lap two and generated a runaway lead of over six seconds by lap four. However, a major incident on lap five took two cars out of contention and immediately deleted any advantages during the safety cars deployment.
Following the restart on lap 14, the frontrunners found themselves caught up with back markers in the GT300 class (SUPER GT is a mixed-class racing competition combining GT500 and GT300 classes, with the two classes of different levels of performance racing together to make the event all the more exciting for fans). This momentary hold-up allowed Heikki Kovalainen to join the chase in the #1 LC 500, eventually pushing into second place by the halfway point.
By lap 30 the teams began to make routine driver changes. In a calculated move, the #1 LC 500 entered the pits at the same time as the lead car, but managed to emerge in front as the DENSO KOBELCO SARD team pulled off a lightning fast pit stop. During this period, the #36 LC 500 of James Rossiter pushed incredibly hard and took the lead until lap 35, creating valuable headway that allowed fellow driver Kazuki Nakajima to leapfrog into the overall lead after their own super-speedy pit stop, ahead of the #1 LC 500.
With the #36 and #1 LC 500s now in first and second position and gaining distance on the rest of the pack, a six-car scrap ensued for third place. However, the two lead cars had their own battle, an intense rivalry that ended in an unavoidable collision on lap 51. The #1 car spun off and was unfortunately hit from behind by a GT300 car as it tried to return to the track, forcing both cars out of contention.
Now unchallenged, Nakajima led his #36 car to the chequered flag with an outstanding lead of 26 seconds  team au TOMS first win of the 2017 season and the third consecutive victory for the Lexus LC 500.
After the qualifying, I was starting to lose my confidence, so I decided to race calmly, Kazuki Nakajima said. But, James did a magnificent job at the wheel and got us to where we could take the lead. That was more than I ever expected. I had a bad time getting through the traffic (of back markers) and it allowed the No. 1 car to catch up with me. There was nothing I could do about the ensuing collision and that was unfortunate. There was some damage to my machine, but fortunately I was somehow able to get to the finish first.
James Rossiter said, It was truly a day full of action. At first, I was running behind the two lead cars and that was the toughest part. But after the safety car came out, I thought that the real race would be from that point on, so I pushed hard. I kept running in full-attack mode, and I really enjoyed it. We got the win, so I am satisfied.
Race Notes:
No. 36 LEXUS LC 500 au TOMS (Kazuki Nakajima and James Rossiter)
Race: 1st, 65 laps
Best Lap: 137.005

Al-Futtaim Motors sees stellar growth in its hybrid sales
JUNE 28, 2017 Al-Futtaim Motors, leader in sustainable mobility and exclusive distributor of Toyota in the UAE, has announced an unprecedented increase in its Toyota hybrid sales led by the Prius and Camry hybrid, registering 535% and 430% growth respectively in the first half of this year, in comparison to the same period in 2016.
Launched last year in the UAE, Toyota Prius delivers enhanced fuel efficiency of 26.1 Km/L, and is the worlds first mass-produced hybrid vehicle employing both a petrol engine and an electric motor. The hybrid car can be powered by the engine, the electric motor or a combination of both, automatically choosing the most efficient mode for the best mileage and lowest emission. Since its introduction in 1997 Toyota has sold over 3.7 million Prius around the globe, with cumulative hybrid sales surpassing 10 million since then, resulting in approximately 77 million fewer tons of CO2 emissions and saving approximately 29 million kilolitres of gasoline.
In the UAE fleet business, over 1,000 Camry Hybrid vehicles have been an integral part for a number of taxi operators including Dubai Taxi Corporation, Cars Taxi, National Taxi, Metro Taxi, Arabia Taxi, Citi Taxi, Union Taxi and Emirates Cab, lessening the burden on the environment by contributing to cleaner, less polluted air in the country.
Saud Abbasi, Managing Director of Toyota at Al-Futtaim Motors, said: In light of the sustainability initiatives that the UAE government is implementing as part of its UAE Vision 2021, we take pride in being the pioneer in sustainable motoring and our customers confidence in our hybrid offerings reiterate our position. Our hybrid cars offer an immediate solution to a greener UAE, requiring no additional infrastructure development, no external charging and no changes in driver behaviour.
This positive growth for both the Prius and the Camry Hybrid are proof that our customers are becoming increasingly aware of the environmental and financial benefits of owning hybrid cars. Studies show that a regular person could save up to one ton of CO2 using his Prius for a year, while a fleet of hybrid taxi cars could save over 30% on fuel while emitting over 30% less CO2, given current fuel prices in the UAE, it costs the Prius customer AED 6.7 to drive a distance of 100 kilometres in his car,
Earlier this year, Al-Futtaim Motors announced a new partnership with Toyota Motor Corporation, Masdar, Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) and Air Liquide, in a joint research program to explore the potential of hydrogen energy use in the UAE for the creation of a sustainable, low-carbon society. As part of the program, Al-Futtaim Motors has deployed a number of Mirai fuel-cell vehicle (FCV) for testing on UAE roads.
Al-Futtaim Motors has showcased the zero-emission hydrogen-powered electric Toyota Mirai at a number of exhibitions and sustainability events to give the public and key government stakeholders the opportunity to witness what the future of sustainable transport could look like.

Depending on the model, the key safety features include, Pre-Crash System, a combination of collision detection and collision preparation systems, Dynamic Radar Cruise Control which supplements the conventional system with a vehicle-to-vehicle distance control mode and helps maintain a suitable distance from the preceding vehicle, Lane-Keeping Assist which detects lane markings on the road and then provides information and steering assistance in accordance with the road and driving conditions, Automatic High Beam which detects nearby lights and automatically switches between high beams and low beams to ensure optimum night-time visibility, in addition to Parking Assist, Rear Cross Traffic Alert, Blind Spot Monitor, Vehicle Stability Control and Anti-lock Braking System.

Lexus hybrid sales soar 225% in the first half of 2017 in the UAE
JULY 12, 2017 Al-Futtaim Motors, leader in sustainable mobility and exclusive distributor of Lexus in the UAE, has announced a 225% increase in its hybrid sales for the first half of this year, compared to the same period in 2016, bolstering the companys support for the UAE Vision 2021.
The upsurge in hybrid sales was mainly driven by the Lexus RX h, which accounted for approximately 25% of all RX sales, followed by CT h, GS h and LS h. The recently launched LC 500h Coupe is the latest addition to the growing Lexus hybrid line-up, and introduces the worlds first multi-stage hybrid system in an emotionally captivating, high-performance model.
Christopher Buxton, Managing Director of Lexus at Al-Futtaim Motors, commented: We take pride in leading the green luxury mobility through the largest line-up of hybrid offer in the UAE, and we are grateful to our customers who have supported us in our journey towards a more sustainable future. The stellar growth in our hybrid sales is concrete evidence that UAE motorists have become more sensitive towards ever-growing environmental issues. We have cemented our commitment to making sustainable mobility widely available by price matching our hybrid models with their petrol equivalent, the RX and more recently LC 500 are just two examples.
Globally, Lexus pioneered hybrid technology in 2005 with the launch of RX 400h, the first full hybrid premium SUV. Gradually, the brand expanded its hybrid offering by launching the first full premium hybrid sedan, GS 450h, in 2006 and in 2007 the most powerful full hybrid sedan, LS 600h, was introduced. 2011 witnessed the launch of the first full hybrid premium compact, CT 200h, and in 2014 the first premium mid-size crossover, NX 300h was sold. 2015 saw the introduction of the first full premium hybrid sports coupe, RC 300h. In 2017 the first multi-stage hybrid vehicle was introduced with the launch of the LC 500h
Today, globally, Lexus sells 10 full hybrid models and is the premium brand with the largest full hybrid line-up.
Hybrid technology is the most environmentally practical mobility solution contributing to air quality improvement, as it requires no infrastructure changes, offers no compromise on the driving range and does not impose any change on the drivers behavior.
In the UAE, Al-Futtaim Motors offers 5 luxury hybrid vehicles including Lexus LC 500h, LS 600h, GS 450h, RX 450h and CT 200h

Al-Futtaim Motors ushers low-carbon mobility through commercial vehicles
JULY 19, 2017 Al-Futtaim Motors, leader in sustainable mobility and exclusive distributor of Hino in the UAE, handed over a Hino 300 Series hybrid truck to Oasis Water Company, in line with its environmental mobility agenda.
The handover, which took place at Oasis Waters Headquarters, was attended by Ramez Hamdan, General Manager of Hino at Al-Futtaim Motors accompanied by a delegation from Hino Japan, George Antonios, Marketing Director of National Food Products Company in addition to a number of senior officials from both organizations.
The custom-built Hino 300 series Hybrid light-duty truck has been modified by Gorica to suit the requirements of the business and now features a mounted half chiller, half freezer body that has been manufactured with high-quality GRP panels, ensuring conformity to market requirements, particularly in the hot summer months.
The Hino 300 Series Hybrid light-duty truck features the worlds first hybrid diesel engine designed to deliver cleaner, more efficient transport solutions. The truck employs a Euro 4 and EVV compliant 4L diesel engine matched to an auxiliary electric motor that is emission-free, which significantly reduces emissions of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, particulate matter and nitrogen oxide.
Our relationship with Oasis goes back many years, with a large part of their fleet consisting of Hino trucks. The introduction of the Hino 300 Series Hybrid is a concrete evidence of the mutual environmental values Oasis Water shares with Al-Futtaim Motors in our efforts to enhance air quality in the UAE and reduce our carbon footprint on the environment in line with UAEs 2021 vision, said Ramez Hamdan.
As a market leader in the packaged water industry we understand that our intention to improve the quality of life of our community through access to convenient and affordable water solutions must be balanced with the potential impact our industry has on the environment we live in, said George Antonios.
The Hino 300 Series Hybrid light-duty truck features the worlds first hybrid diesel engine designed to deliver cleaner, more efficient transport solutions.

Al-Futtaim Toyota pioneers innovative Payment Protection Plan to provide peace of mind to customers
JULY 27, 2020 Al-Futtaim Toyota announces the launch of the Toyota Payment Protection Plan, which is applicable across all models and covers up to six months installments or up to AED 20,000 in case of involuntary loss of employment. The solution was developed in direct response to the current challenges being faced by consumers.
To confirm the effectiveness of the new Payment Protection Plan, which was introduced as a first of its kind in the UAE, Al-Futtaim Toyota conducted a series of surveys among its latest customers. The results of the survey were overwhelmingly in favor of the plan, which is being offered completely free to customers who had purchased new Toyota vehicles. Survey results show that majority of customers (76%) considered the plan to be either valuable or extremely valuable towards helping them make their purchase decision.
Aside from offering the innovative Payment Protection Plan, Al-Futtaim Toyota has also actively provided customers with cost-effective solutions to keep them on the road in the current circumstances. As the market leader in the UAE, Al-Futtaim Toyota has paved the way for the growing popularity of flexible leasing solutions to small and medium sized companies, thereby allowing them to get take advantage of the surge in demand for home deliveries. With its newly introduced expanded leasing options, both retail and business customers in the UAE can now lease almost any Toyota vehicle, without committing to a long-term purchase.
Saud Abbasi, Managing Director at Al-Futtaim Toyota said, As we adjust to the new normal, Al-Futtaim Toyota has a role to play in providing the best possible value to our customers. Furthermore, we are committed to empowering local businesses and drive growth to stimulate the economy. We will continue to innovate to adapt to the market and provide solutions that suit the current demands of our retail and SME customers.

Trading Enterprises  Volvo aims to transform retail business with integrated online/offline consumer experience
SEPTEMBER 24, 2020 Trading Enterprises, the exclusive distributor of Volvo in the UAE, and part of the Al-Futtaim Automotive Group, has announced today that Volvo Cars is fundamentally modernising and upgrading the way its customers buy, lease, subscribe to and service their cars globally as it works towards its ambition to sell 50 per cent of its global volume online by 2025.
The company has today announced its acquisition of Upplands Motor, the Stockholm-based dealership (subject to regulatory approvals), and a planned full takeover of the retailer Bra Bil, with the aim to merge the two operations with Volvo Bil, its own dealership.
The merged operation will enable Volvo Cars to pilot a technology-led transformation of its retail operations in its home market. Its strategy is to create a seamless online/offline experience, together with its retail partners, globally. This merged operation will enable Volvo Cars to fully utilise the strong home market to gain knowledge and develop the future business model.
Volvo Cars believes customers want the same kind of modern, hassle-free retail experience when buying or servicing their car that they enjoy elsewhere. The traditional retail system has served customers well for decades but as the leading automotive brand in Sweden, Volvo now needs to transform to meet future consumer demands head on.
This is about changing together. The physical retailer and the opportunity for consumers to engage with dedicated, enthusiastic and qualified Volvo personnel remains crucial to our future. We are committed to improving customers experiences by working closely  together  with our retail partners, said Bjrn Annwall, head of the EMEA region at Volvo Cars.
As the world around us changes rapidly, and consumers interact with the Volvo brand in even more ways, we need to make sure that every interaction adds to their total Volvo experience, says Lex Kerssemakers, head of commercial operations at Volvo Cars.
This is key to our commercial transformation and why we focus on a seamless interaction between online and offline. Todays investment is another milestone as we create a modern, personalised customer experience together with our retailers. Earlier this year, Trading Enterprises- Volvo launched its e-commerce platform, becoming the first Volvo Cars distributor in the Middle East to provide online buying options for Volvo customers through a true brand experience.

Introducing the all-new Toyota Hilux Adventure  ready to dominate the lifestyle pickup segment
AUGUST 16, 2020  For the first time ever, Al-Futtaim Toyota introduces the retail grade Toyota Hilux Adventure available for expats and locals alike  The eighth-generation Hilux is equipped with a 4-liter V6 235 horsepower engine and strengthens the brands reputation of unbeatable capability
Al-Futtaim Toyota, the exclusive Toyota distributor in the UAE, is shaking up the lifestyle pickup segment with the introduction of the all-new eighth-generation Toyota Hilux Adventure. This is the first time ever that the Hilux is available as a retail model in the UAE, meaning that it is no longer limited to dominating the commercial-use sector.
The much-awaited Hilux Adventure is a leisure vehicle specially designed for active family life, which could include long road trips, off-road exploration, camping, fishing, and other lifestyle activities that require a lot of gear.
Tested and approved by two-time Le Mans 24 Hours winner and two-time Formula 1 world champion Fernando Alonso, the Spaniard dubbed the latest Hilux invincible and paid praises to the suspension and ride quality. The unstoppable Hilux keeps impressing, having already conquered both the North Pole and the Antarctic, as well as every point in between including locations as remote as Icelandic volcanoes. Last year Toyota additionally added a historic notch to the Hiluxs tally of successes with an outright win at the gruesome Dakar rally, the greatest test of man and machine run over 5,600km of every terrain imaginable.
Saud Abbasi, Managing Director at Al-Futtaim Toyota said, We have been constantly asked for a retail version of the Hilux, and now, I can proudly announce that its finally here and that customers, Emiratis and expats alike, do not need a commercial license to enjoy this tough machine. I believe the Hilux Adventure will be a strong player in the lifestyle pick-up segment thanks to its striking new design, powerful powertrain, and technological updates We are extremely confident that this vehicle will exceed the expectations of those who have waited for it for so long.
With special features throughout, the Hilux Adventure is distinguished by an athletic look, which includes a three-dimensional trademarked front grille and specially designed front bumper to significantly strengthen its impressive street presence. With a beefy skid plate, wide arch extensions to fit the large 18-inch alloy wheels and tyres, as well as unique door handle and tailgate designs, the Hilux Adventure is a sight to behold both on and off the road.
Whats more, for the first time in the UAE, the Hilux Adventure packs a proven 4.0-litre V6 engine producing 235 horsepower at 5,600rpm and 38.3kg-m of torque at 4,400rpm. With an automatic transmission and switchable four-wheel drive and six speed automatic, the performance excels on any terrain, with particular focus during development on the new suspension design which enhances both ride comfort and handling. New front and rear shock absorbers and an improved leaf spring design as well as new bushings combined with the latest generation Vehicle Stability Control system, ensure class-leading dynamics wherever life may take you.
Inside the vehicle, the design is just as impressive as its performance, with the muscular black interior that comes with a new multi-information display and 8.0-inch centre console infotainment unit, with the latest suite of software and graphics enhancement plus Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration. The rear of the Hilux Adventure comes with rear bed-liner and tonneau cover as standard as well as a rear-view camera, parking sensors, parking support clearance sonar, LED rear combination lamps and on-board air compressor.
For the exterior, there are eleven colors available including white, orange, silver, gray, blue, red, bronze and black.
Fit for any purpose and any journey, the Hilux Adventure offers best-in-class capability at an unbeatable rate  customers can visit any Al-Futtaim Toyota dealership in the UAE and drive away in the new 2021 Hilux Adventure starting from AED143,000.

After quickly adapting to a market in Q2 that was riddled with curfews, lockdowns and travel restrictions, Al-Futtaim Toyotas third quarter performance tells a story of recovery, stability and even market share growth.
Thanks to a sturdy line-up of dependable segment leaders and thrilling new models joining the portfolio, Al-Futtaim Toyota continued gaining market share in Q3, ending September 2020 with 36% compared to 32.0% the year before.
One of the main drivers of this growth has been the impactful entry of new and exciting models such as the all-new Toyota C-HR, which has changed the rules of the compact SUV game in one bold stroke. This ultra-stylish vehicle which combines daring design with a responsive drive and class-leading eco-friendly technology, contributed to strong sales in the last three months.
Another new entry that has expanded Toyotas leadership in the SUV segment is the Highlander, which proves that large vehicles can also be eco-friendly. Al-Futtaim Toyota brought a new level of efficiency and technology to the UAEs SUV market with the launch of its biggest Hybrid-Electric Vehicle (HEV) to date. Available exclusively with an HEV powertrain, the all-new Toyota Highlander took its place at the pinnacle of Toyotas electrified SUV line-up. With a commitment to green motoring in the UAE, Al-Futtaim Toyota offers no less than five hybridelectric models today. This broadening of the line-up contributed to Toyota hybrid sales increasing by 8% year-on-year.
Al-Futtaim Toyota also shook up the lifestyle pick-up segment with its latest launch  the introduction the all-new eighth-generation Toyota Hilux Adventure. This marks the first time that the Hilux was made available as a retail model in the UAE, meaning that it is no longer limited to dominating the commercial-use sector  and is now available for sale to expats.
Aside from its product offering, Al-Futtaim Toyota also introduced new and innovative ownership solutions such as retail and commercial leasing, which provides customers with tailor-fit packages that meet both their mobility as well as their financial needs.
Despite a challenging year and slowing car sales in the region, Toyota sales increased on the back of the introduction of innovative and much-anticipated enthusiast products. The increase in sales is a result of our continued commitment to our customers and timely responses to the market needs. We are confident that the new additions to our line-up will play a bigger role in 2021 along with further new launches. With another three months to go of the year, we are not slowing down, and we can promise our customers that we have more excitement to come for the rest of 2020, said Saud Abbasi, Managing Director of Al-Futtaim Toyota.

The Legend Continues: The all-new 2021 Toyota GR Supra Hits the UAE
NOVEMBER 1, 2020 One year after the legend returned to turn heads and set enthusiasts hearts racing after a 17-year wait, Al-Futtaim Toyota has welcomed the 2021 GR Supra, sure to continue to excite loyal fans across the UAE.
When the all-new fifth-generation model returned ready to set the roads ablaze last year, it was a comeback only fitting of the Toyota Supra story. The MK5 lived up to the hype and Toyotas engineers and designers delivered a car that evoked power, desire, and the thrill of heart-pounding performance. This years upgraded version is here to enhance its formidable reputation as an all-conquering, giant-slaying machine. Whether on the highway or the track, the 2021 Supra is now in the UAE to take its race-to-road technology to the top of the segment and the podium.
Throughout the development process, the Supra is designed with the consideration of creating the sense of becoming one with the car; with engineers ensuring that the car properly hugs the road and delivers excellent stability, offering supreme driving confidence regardless of surface conditions. Living up to the heady expectations of some of the worlds most devoted enthusiasts, the 2.0L version of the car accelerates from zero to 100km/h in just 5.2 seconds, with the 3.0L hitting the 100km/h mark in just 4.1 seconds and an electronically limited top speed of 250km/h.
The 2021 Toyota Supra stays true to its front-engined, rear-wheel-drive layout which set it apart all these years, not forgetting of course the heart of the beast  a longitudinally-mounted in-line turbocharged engine. Available in a 2.0L and 3.0L version, both cars come with an 8-speed automatic transmission with the 2.0L boasting a four-cylinder turbo engine and the 3.0L a six-cylinder turbo engine.
The world-class sports car has a 2,470mm wheelbase delivering 255 horsepower and 400Nm of torque at 2.0L and 382 horsepower and 500Nm of torque at 3.0L to the grippy rear tyres, mounted on lightweight, 18-inch alloy wheels for the 2.0L and forged aluminium 19-inch wheels on the 3.0L version. Both these engines deliver amazing power to weight ratios.
Saud Abbasi, Managing Director of Al-Futtaim Toyota said, The Supra is an automotive icon that truly blows people away by its performance. When we brought the legend back last year, customers told us that it simply fed their desire to just get in and drive so we knew we couldnt wait too long to introduce the next version. The Supra GR 2021 is an unprecedented combination of power, beauty and technology, not to mention safety, capable of taking on the very best in the sports car arena.
Along with the multifunctional three-spoke sports steering wheel, the 2021 GR Supra also features dual-zone air-conditioning, Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB), a 12-speaker JBL sound system, wireless charger, Normal and Sport driving modes, sports pedals, a head-up display projecting critical data directly ahead of the driver, dual sports exhaust, adaptive LED lights, smart keyless entry and body-coloured details. Additional styling on the 3.0L blue edition features with 19 matte-black wheels, beautiful black pillar stripes to add an air of sophistication, stunning redline on the bodykits and Toyota Supra logo on the red brake calipers.
The Supra comes equipped with front, side, curtain and drivers knee airbags, plus assistance technologies such as adaptive cruise control, blind-spot monitor, pre-collission system, lane change assist, traffic sign recognition, tyre pressure monitoring, a rear-view camera and more.
The 2021 Toyota GR Supra is available in a range of eight exciting colors, including Matte Storm Gray Metallic, a matte finish with a hint of blue that creates an impressive, finely honed image. New for the 3.0L version is the Horizon blue colour. The interior for 2.0L version comes in Alcantara Black/Red and with a black/blue accent available for the 3.0L Blue Edition.

UAE Customers Can Build and Book Their Dream Car Online with Innovative Lexus Car Configurator
NOVEMBER 17, 2020
Al-Futtaim Lexus, the exclusive distributor of Lexus cars in the UAE and part of the Al-Futtaim Automotive Group has announced today a game changing partnership with Facebook, enabling UAE customers to build and book their very own Lexus online for the very first time in the UAE.
The announcement came as the leading automotive dealership is making major developments to its logistic and marketing operations to adjust to the changing market circumstances. Created to deliver a seamless online consumer experience, the Lexus Car Configurator will enable car enthusiasts to explore the entire Lexus range, customise their car from body to engine, book a test drive, reserve it and even pay a deposit, all through their mobile phones without leaving their Facebook newsfeed. This is enabled by a series of linked Instant Experiences that are interactive, a special execution developed by Facebooks MENA solutions engineering team. Users can engage with videos and photos, swipe through carousels, tilt to pan and explore lifestyle images  all in a full screen experience ad.
Saad Abdullah, Head of Marketing and Brand Operations at Lexus UAE said: Consumer trends are changing at a fast pace and as leaders in the UAE automotive market, we are committed to meeting our customers needs and innovate solutions that take their car buying journey to the next level. The Lexus Car Configurator is the result of us working together with Facebook and our partners Memac Ogilvy to elevate the user journey for UAE car buyers.

Leen Fakhreddin, Creative Agency Lead MEA at Facebook added: Through our strategic partnership with Memac Ogilvy, we developed a pioneering configurator that people can use directly in their Facebook app. Configurators are a critical part of the car-buying journey, but theyre often designed for desktop in a time where more and more car buyers are doing their pre-purchase discovery and research on their mobile devices. The car configurator will not only enable Lexus to connect with car buyers when theyre in the early consideration phase but also allow users to experience the brand by booking a test drive and paying a deposit on the car of their dreams.

Al-Futtaims Trading Enterprises  Volvo Cars invests in designing and developing electric motors in-house
16 November 2020
Trading Enterprises, the exclusive distributor of Volvo cars in the UAE and part of Al-Futtaim Automotive announced today that Volvo Cars is making significant investments that allow for the in-house design and development of electric motors for the next generation of Volvo models, as the company continues to move towards becoming a fully electric car maker.
The company today opened a brand-new electric motor lab in Shanghai, China, the latest addition to its global network of facilities for the development and testing of electric car components. The lab comes in addition to ongoing e-motor development in Gothenburg, Sweden and state-of-the-art battery labs in China and Sweden.
Taking over the role of the internal combustion engine in car engineering, e-motors are a fundamental building block of electric cars, together with the battery and power electronics. The interplay between these three component areas is crucial in developing premium electric cars.
Bringing the development of electric motors in-house will allow Volvo Cars engineers to further optimise electric motors and the entire electric driveline in new Volvos. This approach will allow engineers to make further gains in terms of energy efficiency and overall performance.
Oscar Rivoli, Managing Director at Trading Enterprises  Volvo said, It is important for us to provide our customers with a comfortable and efficient driving experience. Through in-house design and development, we can fine-tune our e-motors to ever better levels. By constantly improving their overall performance levels in terms of energy efficiency and comfort, we create an electric driving experience that is unique to Volvo.
E-motors enable hallmark features that electric cars are known for, such as instant acceleration and so-called One Pedal Driving, whereby drivers use the gas pedal both for acceleration and deceleration, depending on whether they push in or lift their foot off the pedal.
The newly opened electric motor lab in Shanghai became operational last month. It will mainly focus on electric motor development for use in fully electric and hybrid cars based on Volvo Cars forthcoming SPA 2 modular vehicle architecture.
The investments in e-motor design and development represent yet another step towards Volvo Cars climate ambitions and electrification strategy. It aims for 50 per cent of its sales to be fully electric vehicles by 2025, with the rest hybrids.
Electrification is part of the companys comprehensive climate plan which addresses carbon emissions across all its operations and products, towards its ambition to become climate-neutral by 2040.
The plan goes beyond addressing tailpipe emissions through electrification; the company will also tackle carbon emissions in its manufacturing network and wider operations, its supply chain and through recycling and reuse of materials.
As a first tangible step towards its 2040 vision the company aims to reduce its lifecycle carbon footprint per car by 40 per cent between 2018 and 2025.
A subsidiary of the Al-Futtaim Automotive Group, Trading Enterprises was established in 1970s in Dubai and is the exclusive authorised distributor for Volvo in the UAE. It is empowered by a highly skilled and trained professional team to provide a complete car buying experience. Al-Futtaim Automotive is one of five divisions within the Al-Futtaim Group which provides quality products and services that enrich peoples lives and aspirations each and every day.

Dubai Festival City Delivers an Inspirational Location for the Dynamic New Offices of the Federal Competitiveness and State Authority
Al-Futtaim Group Real Estates (AFGRE) flagship office building, Festival Tower, at Dubai Festival City, is now home to one of the most prestigious and innovatively designed offices in the UAE  the FCSA. The office reflects the FCSAs commitment to providing a new, innovative workspace with a fascinating, visual environment for its employees. Festival Tower was chosen due to its location and proximity to many facilities that benefit FCSA employees such as parking, shopping, and more, which is in line with the UAE vision based on the governments Happiness Agenda, providing a comfortable working environment that raises productivity and work efficiency.
The task of interior design was given to an integrated team from the FCSA comprised of young Emirati talents. This highlights the managements desire to support talented employees and motivate them to be creative and design innovative ideas that improve the work environment and encourage teamwork to achieve common goals. The FCSA work team also added diverse design elements that reflect the mission, values, and goals of the Authority, as well as its tasks of developing the statistics and national matrix, supporting the UAEs competitiveness on the global levels, and helping achieve the UN sustainable development goals.
The diverse nature of the offices interior design adds appeal and variety to the work environment, with, for example, a traditional and quiet reading room that provides privacy for employees. The FCSA also provides many innovative services and facilities for its employees, including a special room for female employees to take care of toddlers; a space for concentration, relaxation, and napping, a massage chair, a video games room, and fully-equipped dining area. The work team was also keen on making the meeting rooms design unconventional; one of them is designed as a traditional Emirati majlis containing elements of Emirati Arabic culture, whilst other meeting rooms are inspired by competitive sports activities, with one resembling a boxing ring and the other a pool table. There is also a recurring visual of the number 1 around the office, as a reminder of the UAEs drive to be a leading force in the world.
The location of the offices was also strategically considered. As Dubai Festival City undergoes a massive redevelopment phase, with a 1.5billion AED redevelopment of Dubai Festival City Mall now complete, the building of a new Holiday Inn on site and a raft of new retail offerings, Festival Tower has become a premium location, hosting over 3,000 employees, just two kilometres from Dubai International Airport and at the heart of Dubai. Employees can enjoy being part of a comprehensive community with an unrivalled location at a unique waterfront setting. For those wishing to shorten their commute there is also a residential area, which is part of the established community, just five minutes away from the office. Whilst access to the facilities of the internationally renowned five-star hotels  Intercontinental and Crowne Plaza, as well as a state-of-the-art Convention Centre located just next door, make it an ideal environment for the professional occupants.
Sumaya Saeed Al Hakeem, Director of the Government Liaising Department at the FCSA, said We are glad to see the result of the time and effort we dedicated to designing the FCSA office at Festival Tower, which has a distinguished location as it is at a cross point of both the new and old Dubai. For our employees based in the other Emirates it also was a practical choice because it is easy to reach.
Al Hakeem also added that the design of the FCSA office was based on the vision of the employees themselves, which enabled the creation of a workspace that isnt just comfortable and transparent, but also increases productivity and team spirit, making it a unique work environment as the details of which reflect the personalities and values of the work team.
Alongside the FCSA, a number of other local and regional enterprises and governmental entities have chosen Festival Tower at Dubai Festival City, which currently has a 95% occupancy rate, as their headquarters. The new occupants, that include the Federal Customs Authority and Commercial Bank International, enjoy an exceptional environment and location with a plethora of amenities close by.

Groupe Renault and Al-Futtaim sign agreements to assemble and distribute Renault vehicles in Pakistan
NOVEMBER 20, 2017 Groupe Renault and Al-Futtaim today announced that they have signed definitive agreements for the exclusive assembly and distribution of Renault vehicles in Pakistan.
Groupe Renault is delighted to extend its international footprint by entering Pakistan, a fast-growing market with a 10% annual growth rate. By partnering with Al-Futtaim, a very professional and renowned automotive partner, Groupe Renault aims to become a major player in Pakistan. We aim to bring our latest products and cutting-edge technology and set new benchmarks of safety and quality in the market, said Fabrice Cambolive, Senior Vice President, Chairman of the Africa Middle-East India Region of the Groupe Renault.
With a population of over 200 million, a fast-growing economy and a vibrant middle-class, Pakistan is undoubtedly a very important strategic growth market for us. We are very excited to represent Groupe Renault which is among the top automotive brands worldwide, and a leading European car manufacturer entering this market. We will endeavor to add real value to the Pakistani auto sector and consumer, and to create a world-class organisation in Pakistan. Al-Futtaim also looks forward to a very long and successful partnership with Groupe Renault, said Len Hunt, President of Al-Futtaim Automotive.
The agreements will see Groupe Renault bring its latest products and technological know-how, whilst Al-Futtaim, through its new subsidiary Al-Futtaim Automotive Pakistan (Private) Limited, will establish a new manufacturing and assembly plant, and exclusively distribute Renault cars through its extensive knowledge of the market. Al-Futtaim has built considerable strength and credibility in delivering great customer experiences through its numerous businesses across 29 countries. Al-Futtaim global automotive operations extend to 11 markets across the Middle East, Africa and South Asia, and Pakistan represents one of the most dynamic opportunities in these regions, in particular due to the new Automotive Development Policy.
As is customary for such projects, the finalization of the transaction remains subject to a number of conditions, mainly relating to relevant regulatory approvals from Pakistani authorities.
The parties expect that the plant will be built starting the first quarter of 2018 in Karachi as per Groupe Renault standards, and car sales are planned to start in 2019, ramping up in 2020.

Arabia Taxi electrifies its fleet with 50 new Toyota Prius
FEBRUARY 5, 2018 In a joint effort to support the UAE Vision 2021s environmental targets and the unwavering march towards a more sustainable motoring, Al-Futtaim Toyota, leader in sustainable mobility since 2008, today announced the handover of first 50 Prius Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEV) to Arabia Taxi, member of Arabia Holdings Group of companies and one of the UAEs largest taxi operators, marking the latter as the first fleet operator in the UAE to use a Prius in its ranks.
The handover ceremony was attended by H.E Eng. Omar Ahmed Bin Omair, General Director of Ajman Public Transport Corporation, Saud Abbasi, Managing Director of Al-Futtaim Toyota, PSM Habibulla Khan, Chairman and Managing Director of Arabia Holdings, as well as senior representatives from both companies.
Commenting on the handover, Abbasi said: Our journey with Arabia Taxi began back in 2005, and throughout those past 13 years, Toyota has proven to be a trusted mobility partner for the many values it offers, including quality, durability reliability, comfort, excellent Total Cost of Ownership and best resale value. It is estimated that each of our Toyota Hybrid Electric Vehicles saves around 7.65 tons of CO2 based on 850,000km of operation, the approximate shelf life of a taxi car in the UAE. Arabia Taxi shares mutual environmental objectives with Al-Futtaim Toyota to make the UAE a greener place
Since its launch 21 years ago, the Prius proved so popular with customers that it became a synonym for an environmentally-friendly vehicle.

If you saw the pile up of cars on Sheikh Zayed Road going towards Abu Dhabi and wondered where the traffic was headed to, then you have witnessed the calm before the storm. The largest IKEA store of Dubai and the third full sized store in the UAE opened its doors today for customers in Jebel Ali. Targeted at nearby communities such as Jebel Ali, Al Furjan, Dubai Marina and surrounding communities, IKEA aims to capture a new growth corridor and come closer to their vision of creating a better everyday life for the many people.
Based in Al Futtaims newest Mall development, Festival Plaza, in the South of Dubai, which opened on the same day, the store is spread across 35,500 square meters including a 5,000 square meters training area for IKEA employees and is also home to the Worlds Tallest IKEA Navigation Tower.
The store was opened in the presence of Omar Al Futtaim, Vice Chairman Al-Futtaim Jon Abrahamsson, CEO of Inter IKEA as well as Carl Morner, Deputy Head of Mission  Embassy of Sweden and selected VIP guests and customers who queued up to witness the opening and be among the first to enter the new store.
Vinod Jayan, Managing Director for IKEA UAE, Egypt and Oman said, At IKEA we are committed to creating a positive impact on people, society and the planet by making sustainable living affordable, attractive and accessible. For many people in the UAE, building a home is one of the key factors to building their life here so our commitment with our new store is to make that an enjoyable experience for all and to be more accessible in the significant area of Dubai South and to nearby commuters.
IKEA Jebel Ali is just not another store opening in the UAE. We promise our customers double the store experience by bringing top class solutions and customer experience to the region, he concluded.
The complete home setup in the new store will provide customers with additional small space living solutions. One such home is set with smart home solutions to show customers how they can easily make the transition to smart living.
Throughout the main showroom, digital signage and projector solutions will provide customers with information about the range of products available as well as guide them through the store and enhance their shopping experience. Approximately 16 home planning wall projectors are built across the store that will allow customers to be able to easily visualize products in their home.
The store will also feature a brand new Customer Planning Studio for customers with extensive kitchen and bathroom requirements making planning easier and improving the overall shopping experience. Along with that, the lighting department will have an exclusive area for all smart home lighting products for ease in selection. The store will also have more inspiring room settings that are tailored specifically for the many different tastes of Dubais 200+ nationalities and backgrounds.
The new store is built with sustainability at its core and contributes to the brands global efforts in this direction. From solar panels that will enable the store to receive more than 20% of its energy from the sun, to efficient AC units and motion-based lighting that will help save energy to power over 400 homes for an entire year, IKEA will also recycle 90% of their operational waste annually to reach a target of using only renewable or recycled materials for their products by 2030.
The IKEA Restaurant, that is now accessible directly from the mall has a capacity of 550 seats  indoor and outdoor. In addition to the ever-famous Meatballs and Salmon, the restaurant will also be installing a tandoori oven to cater to the local needs. Self-ordering terminals and self-service kiosks at IKEA Bistro will be installed to improve service, speed and customer satisfaction.
The newest attraction of the store is the all new bakery which will offer customers a true flavour of Sweden through its freshly baked bread and pastries available at affordable prices. With food at the heart of peoples everyday life and a strong contributor to the IKEA brand, IKEA promises to offer a modern taste of Sweden in its new store and bring customers closer to the Swedish traditions. The range consists of some Swedish classics and other traditional baked goods such as rye bread, cinnamon bun, baguettes and croissants.
The Swedish home furnishing retailer never fails to surprise its customers. As doors opened to the public, the first three customers who entered were gifted iconic IKEA products like PONG Armchair, LVBACKEN Side table and IKEA 365+ cookware set, keeping alive the tradition of making every IKEA store opening special. It doesnt end there; gift vouchers worth AED 1000 were also given to 25 lucky customers.

AUGUST 25, 2020
Swedish furniture giant, IKEA, launched today its all-new 2021 Catalogue at a one-of-its-kind virtual event which hosted over 200 attendees. This years catalogue, which is the 70th edition, is created as a handbook that feels like a friendly and optimistic problem-solver full of smart tips, hands-on ideas and small affordable shifts, rooted in real life at home. It is a way of sharing knowledge and a point of view that a better home creates a better everyday life. The handbook is filled with how-tos that show how creating a better home doesnt have to be complicated, expensive or time consuming. IKEA believes that theres no place more important than home. Thats why for the launch of the new catalogue, it hosted an independent research of more than 5,000 people to understand the wants and needs of the UAE better when it came to life at home. The research also dug into how this has changed since 2019 with the new challenges that the year has seen.
Changing rooms in the face of a pandemic Almost half of the people in UAE found themselves spending more time in a different room this year due to COVID-19, with 41% using their living rooms to work. With the pandemic forcing more people to stay at home, home dcor became a priority with 43% focusing on this in the last three months and more than half (52%) choosing to spend money on their home space rather than saving. Affordability is key to the IKEA business idea, which is built into every product and service to ensure that many people can enjoy a better life at home.

New collections
SYMFONISK For IKEA, part of designing a smart home is about enabling people to create an atmosphere in their home. By integrating technology with home furnishing products and solutions, it can further improve life at home. Great sound doesnt need a lot of physical space and with SYMFONISK bookshelf and table lamp speakers, IKEA and Sonos is challenging the way we think about sound and light at home. The collection is now available to buy in store and online.
SYMFONISK
SAMMANKOPPLA IKEA knows that people today want their personalities to be shown in their home. However, both space and money are limited when living in big cities. Since multi-function and creativity is key in order to enable both a small space living solution and an expressive design piece, IKEA turned to Greyhound Original. The result is a collection influenced by Asia, called SAMMANKOPPLA which means interconnect or unify. The collection is now out in the stores.
SAMMANKOPPLA
LEGO IKEA is a very playful company and knows that playtime is crucial for the well-being of both adults and children. A year ago, LEGO Group and IKEA partnered to explore and develop solutions to stimulate play all around the home. The collaboration will result in BYGGLEK which will be launched in stores later this year in October.

Plant Balls IKEA is also introducing a more sustainable alternative to the iconic IKEA meatball. The new IKEA plant balls look like meat and tastes like meat but do not contain any animal protein or ingredients. The plant-based balls will be launched across all stores in the UAE in November 2020.

Commenting on the launch, Vinod Jayan, Managing Director  IKEA UAE, Egypt and Oman said, Now in its 70th year, the IKEA catalogue 2021 aims to inspire people to live healthier and more sustainable lives at home  this has never been as important as it is today. On the path to a better life at home, small steps make a big difference. An armchair, a rug, a potted plant or a lamp can change your mood, day and perspective.
He continued, We know that many people in the UAE have more limited budgets today. Thats why many of the solutions featured in this years catalogue are accessible for people with any budget and help them maximise their space and transform their favourite rooms.
This years catalogue comes in both a print version as well as digital version that is optimised for different channels and platforms.
Carla Klumpenaar, General Manager, Marketing and Communication commented, The IKEA catalogue 2021 is not just a catalogue  it is a collection of inspiration and knowledge of life at home for all IKEA online and offline channels, for digital and physical touchpoints. We are continuing to develop the global marketing channels and at the same time create content locally to become even more market relevant with a selection of styles, situations, segments and stories.

We know that time is of the essence for the many people therefore with the malls strategic and central location, we will be bringing the IKEA experience closer to peoples homes, in a more convenient and compact IKEA store. Al Wahda Mall remains a top destination for shopping, entertainment and leisure in the heart of Abu Dhabi, so we are thrilled to be able to bring our new IKEA concept store to this location. The full size IKEA store in Yas Island, which operates on an area of 33,000 m2 since 2011, will continue to be the go-to destination for the complete inspiring IKEA experience, so our goal is to create a closer glimpse of that experience at the heart of the Abu Dhabi Island.
The store comes in line with the brands growth strategy across the region and commitment to bricks-and-mortar stores across its operating markets. The Abu Dhabi Wahda Mall store aims to build on the success of the IKEA expansion plans, that have already been seen at its Jebel Ali Festival Plaza Store, the largest in Dubai.

A behind-the-scenes look at ACE Festival Plazas new greenhouse
Working with architects, structural consultants, MEP designers, and experts in greenhouse concepts and hydroponics solutions; ACEs greenhouse is a feat of engineering that is aligned with authority regulations.
The enclosed temperature and humidity-controlled greenhouse is maintained at a comfortable 30 degrees celsius, perfect for outdoor plants.
The greenhouses heat sensors are automatically activated if the temperature crosses 30 degrees. In order to maintain the climate-controlled environment, the greenhouse has cooling pads on one side and exhaust fans on the other. This sophisticated system creates an air flow that the plants need to thrive.
What about humidity? Thats controlled too. Once the humidity reaches 70% in the greenhouse, a misting system is activated to reduce the overall humidity to allow shoppers to enjoy cooler temperatures.
The water within the cooling pad wall is recycled in a reservoir at the base and is then pumped back up to the top to be reused in the cooling process.
This sustainable process is designed to use water mindfully, making the greenhouse ideal for shoppers and the environment.
Mirroring natures cooling process, ACE uses evaporative cooling technology in its greenhouse. This type of low-energy, eco-friendly technology ensures that the air in the greenhouse is always fresh. Heres a look at how it works.
Water is circulated through a pump station and supplied to the top of the cooling pad. The water then flows down the evaporative cooling pads corrugated surface and part of it is evaporated by the warm, dry air that passes through the pad. The air that leaves the pad is, as a result, cooled and humidified simultaneously without the need for an external energy supply to support the evaporation process. The rest of the water assists in washing the pad and is drained back to the pump station to start the process all over again.
Always a helpful place, ACE Festival Plazas resident experts can guide gardening beginners and enthusiasts through its new section.

Al-Futtaim Motors leads the charge against counterfeit car parts in the UAE
NOVEMBER 1, 2017 As part of its on-going efforts to protect the rights and safety of consumers, Al-Futtaim Motors, leader in sustainable mobility since 2008 and exclusive distributor of Toyota and Lexus in the UAE, conducted, in partnership with government authorities, 20 raids on counterfeit car part distributors in the first three quarters of this year, resulting in the confiscation of over AED 36 million worth of counterfeit parts.
In order to help raise awareness on the dangers of counterfeit car parts, Al-Futtaim Motors conducted a series of trainings, helping over 240 government officials in Dubai and Abu Dhabi differentiate between genuine and fake Toyota parts and provided the right tools to further educate the public about the importance of using genuine parts.
As part of its public awareness campaign, Al-Futtaim Motors in partnership with the Dubai Police conducted two exhibitions throughout the third quarter at two different shopping malls, to educate the public about the risk involved in using fake car parts, and to help them spot suspicious products sold by unauthorized distributors.
Saud Abbasi, Managing Director of Toyota at Al-Futtaim Motors said Fake parts are not produced by certified manufacturers, hence; they dont meet any of the safety and quality standards set by the manufacturer. Customers need to be informed of the importance of buying only genuine parts for their vehicles, at authorized dealers, otherwise they could be putting themselves, their loved ones and the public at risk.
Toyota genuine parts, sold by Al-Futtaim Motors are built to meet the highest in quality standards, thus adding to its quality, reliability and durability.

Discover the power of hybrid electric luxury vehicles by Lexus
NOVEMBER 23, 2017 Lexus fans have been given an exclusively electrifying opportunity to sit behind the wheel of their favorite Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEV) and enjoy the smoothest yet eco-conscious drive of the largest line-up of green luxury Lexus vehicles, in the heart of Dubai Design District (D3), at a day-long unique activity that culminated in an amazing drive-in cinema experience.
This comes on the heel of launching the 5th generation of the much-awaited LS h, the original luxury disruptor that has set benchmarks for powertrain smoothness, ride quietness, craftsmanship, documented dependability and long-term quality for the past 28 years.
While the hybrid electric discussion has significantly increased in the past two years, Lexus believes that nothing like a hands-on experience could demonstrate how practical HEV technology is, requiring no external charging, and imposing absolutely no change on the drivers behavior.
In addition to the recently launched LS Hybrid Titanium, the test drive activity involved other Lexus HEVs, such as the LC 500 h coupe, best-selling hybrid electric SUV, the RX h, GS Hybrid F Sport and the compact CT h.
Christopher Buxton, Managing Director of Lexus at Al-Futtaim Motors, said: This event aims at reiterating our commitment to environmentally-friendly luxury motoring, and raising awareness of the most practical low-emission technology that is readily available today for individuals or corporations who desire to make a difference to the air quality in the country.
The D3 event ended with a drive-in cinema experience, where guests were treated to the first of its kind Lexus Hybrid Drive-In Cinema experience in the UAE where the world renowned movie, Grease, was shown.

Al-Futtaim Motors shares future vision of low carbon hydrogen society
DECEMBER 11, 2017 Toyota, leading car brand in sustainable mobility, exclusively distributed in the UAE by Al-Futtaim Motors, was a key speaker at the Clean Air Forum, an event hosted by the Environmental Agency Abu Dhabi, and the Department of Economic Department, where it shared not only its achievements in the field of sustainable mobility over the course of the past 9 years but also its vision of the future zero-emissions motoring in the UAE.
Speaking at the event, Len Hunt, President Automotive Group at Al-Futtaim, discussed Toyotas plans to bring more sustainable motoring solutions to the UAE, and explained the role Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle technology (FCEV) can play to support the goals set by the UAE Vision 2021.
Hunt said: We are very fortunate to be living in the UAE, under the leadership of a very wise and progressive government, that is committed to serious sustainability targets and drastic changes in the way that deals with the environment. A key player in enabling such change is the automotive sector, being a major user of energy after oil and gas.
Hunt explained that in order to face the current environmental issues, Toyota Motor Corporation will be in gradual detachment from fossil fuel and a greater reliance on electric power through the promotion of next-generation vehicles with zero CO2 emissions, such as Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles.
He continued: Toyota has a very strong heritage in developing sustainable cars. In fact, Toyotas cumulative global sales of hybrid electric vehicles crossed the 10 million units mark, resulting in approximately 77 million fewer tons of CO2 emissions. This demonstrates the staying power of the electric propulsion technology that is now emerging as a mainstream solution to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants.
Hunt explained that new technologies such as the zero-emissions FCEVs, once adopted on a large national scale, can actively help the UAE in its march towards a serious climate action thanks to the many practical benefits they present, such as zero pollutants, zero behavioral change, long mileage and minimal hydrogen filling time of 3 to 5 minutes.
Al-Futtaim Motors has been working closely with the UAE government in an effort to raise awareness about FCEVs, and has recently handed over a Toyota Mirai FCEV to Abu Dhabi Police, as part of their Future Police Plan 1957- 2057, which aims at converting all of Abu Dhabi Police fleet to hydrogen-based line-up.
An Abu Dhabi Police branded Mirai FCEV has been showcased at the Clean Air Forum and was a key attraction to all attending officials and academics.

Toyota sells over 1.52 million electrified vehicles in 2017, three years ahead of 2020 target
FEBRUARY 13, 2018 Toyota Motor Corporation recently announced that it reached a landmark milestone in annual sales of electrified powertrains in 2017 with over 1.52 million sold worldwide as of February 2, 2018, surpassing the prior record set in 2016 by eight percent. The numerical milestone marks back-to-back years of growth and accomplishment of one of Toyotas Environmental Challenge 2050 goals, selling more than 1.5 million electrified vehicles in a single year, three years in advance of the original target set for 2020. Additionally, cumulative sales of electrified vehicles now exceed 11.47 million, which represents a reduction of more than 90 million tons of CO2 compared to sales of equivalent conventional vehicles.
In just over 20 years, we have seen the sale of electrified vehicle increase from under 500 sales to more than 1.5 million, said Shigeki Terashi, Executive Vice President, Toyota Motor Corporation. This is a testament from our customers to the quality, durability, and reliability (QDR) of our electrified powertrains, and, thanks to them, this enables us to establish a solid and sustainable foundation for the mass production of a more diverse portfolio of electrified vehicles across our range.
Yugo Miyamoto, Chief Representative of Middle East & North Africa Representative Office, Toyota Motor Corporation, said, We are excited to achieve this significant milestone, which reinforces our commitment to tackling environmental challenges. Toyota has the competitive expertise and know-how in the core technologies of electrification thanks to its experience in developing, producing, and improving major electrified components and many years of collecting feedback from markets around the world. We are deeply grateful to our customers in the MENA region for being an integral part of our success journey, and for continuously extending their support towards our commitment to environmental sustainability.
Since the introduction of its first commercially available electrified powertrain on the Prius in Japan in 1997, Toyota has worked on improving the technology as the basis for its electrification efforts, having launched first mass-produced Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle (FCEV), the Mirai, in 2014, the fourth generation of the Prius hybrid electric vehicle in 2016, and the second-generation Prius Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV) in 2017. The company will continue the development and diversification of electrified vehicles as it now turns its sights to include the mass production of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) from 2020, starting in China and India, followed by Japan, the United States, and Europe. Toyota also aims to further expand sales of Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs) in emerging markets to further contribute to lowering CO2 from new vehicles sales worldwide.
The efforts to improve and increase the diversity of electrified powertrain options is tied directly to Toyotas Environmental Challenge 2050, wherein the company aims to achieve annual electrified vehicle sales of 5.5 million units by 2030, as announced in December 2017. To achieve its goal, Toyota unveiled plans to have 10 BEV models available worldwide by the early 2020s, and from around 2025, the company aims to have an electrified version available for all vehicle models across its global lineup.
Note: Electrified powertrains or electrified vehicles may refer to Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs), Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs), Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs), and Fuel-Cell Electric Vehicles (FCEVs).

DC Aviation Al-Futtaims second hangar on track for year-end completion
MAY 22, 2017 As part of its expansion plan, DC Aviation Al-Futtaim, a joint venture between DC Aviation Group based in Germany and Al-Futtaim, has announced that its second hangar located at Dubai South is on course for completion before the end of the year.
The 6,800sqm hangar will more than double the hangar capacity bringing its total land-side plot area to 24,000sqm and apron area to 13,000sqm. The new hangar will enable DCAF to add two single-aisle aircraft maintenance bays and provide enough space for an additional workshop and equipment storage. It will also significantly increase the number and size of aircraft that can be accommodated at the facility.
Commenting on the progress of the new hangar, Holger Ostheimer, Managing Director of DC Aviation Al-Futtaim, said: The contractors have made significant progress and we are on track to complete the hangar in time for the Dubai Airshow later this year. On completion of the second hangar, we will be able to accommodate aircraft up to the Boeing 767 and significantly ramp up our maintenance capabilities.
Since commencing operations in November 2013, we have seen our business grow steadily year-on-year. Our facility offers the shortest distance from limousine drop-off to aircraft steps and the highest levels of privacy and safety both of which have been widely appreciated and accepted by customers and operators. With the new hangar, we will be able to meet the growing demand for business and private jet operations in the Aviation District at Dubai South for years to come, he added.
The new hangar will also see, DCAF further expand its maintenance services. The company recently received its CAR145 approval from the UAEs General Civil Aviation Authority (GCAA) to provide line maintenance for the Dassault Falcon 7X aircraft type. With the extension of the CAR145 approval, DCAF is now able to provide B1 (airframe) and B2 (avionics) maintenance services for the Falcon 7X at its hangar located at Dubai South.
In addition to the Falcon 7X, DCAF can provide line maintenance support for customers operating the Bombardier Global Express, Challenger 604/605, Airbus 320 family, and the Global 6000 and Global 5000 Vision Flight Deck aircraft types.
The existing DCAF hangar measures 5,700sqm and can easily accommodate multiple ACJ or BBJ type aircraft, ultra-long range business jets such as the Falcon 7X, Global Express or Gulfstream G650.
Located in a prime position just off the airports runway, the DCAF hangar and 7,700sqm dedicated ramp parking enable 24-7 support, maintenance services and operation of private and businesses jets of all sizes.
DCAF has a total of five aircraft on its managed fleet including the Dassault Falcon 7X, two Bombardier Challenger 604, a Global XRS, and a Global 5000.
DCAFs core areas of business include Aircraft management, Maintenance, FBO and Ground Handling and Business jet charter. For more information on DCAFs hangar and services, please visit www.dc-aviation.ae or call +971 4 870 1800.

UNPRECEDENTED INTEREST FROM UAE NATIONALS COMPRISING 40% OF TOTAL PARTICIPANTS. WINNING TEAM TO REPRESENT UAE AT MACAU INTERNATIONAL FINAL IN APRIL 2016.
FEBRUARY 2, 2016 Global Management Challenge, the worlds largest strategy and management competition for students and professionals, has announced that its 2016 UAE edition will be contested by over 900 participants setting a new record for the event which this year is held under the Patronage of His Highness Sheikh Mansoor bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum.
This is a strategic educational initiative sponsored exclusively by Al-Futtaim Automotive with Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum Foundation (MBRF) as the primary knowledge partner. The registration period of this years edition witnessed unprecedented interest from UAE nationals in particular with over 365 Emiratis taking part, which is an increase of over 1,300 per cent compared to last years event.
The launch event held recently at the InterContinental Hotel, Dubai Festival City, was attended by over 350 participants, senior government dignitaries, academic, strategic partners, senior Al-Futtaim Automotive directors all with a shared vision of shaping tomorrows leaders.
His Excellency Jamal bin Huwaireb, Managing Director of MBRF, expressed delight in the Foundations partnership with Al-Futtaim Automotive to sponsor the Global Management Challenge 2016 Competition. The cooperation is in line with the directives of our wise leadership to encourage innovation in all areas to achieve sustainable development. The Global Management Challenge Competition is aligned with the strategic objectives of the Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum Foundation to build a promising generation of future leaders capable of taking forward our communities on the development path at levels, H.E. Bin Huwaireb said.
Len Hunt, President  Al-Futtaim Automotive, said: Through this experiential learning initiative, we are supporting the UAEs national agenda by offering a platform which bridges the gap between university theory and professional practice helping graduates compete in a highly realistic simulated market environment.
Supporting homegrown talent is as important as developing state-of-the-art infrastructure. And for homegrown companies such as Al-Futtaim, the development of talent that is deeply-rooted in the country is an aspect of massive importance to the long-term success and sustainability of the business.
The UAE competition has a strong focus on experiential learning as participants learn by doing, developing skills such as leadership, teamwork, communication, time management, forecasting and much more. Teams have to react to various challenges by inputting data into a software programme with the aim of maximizing investment performance.
Abdulrahman Saqr, Director Human Resources Al-Futtaim Automotive, said: As a company which is integrally linked with the nations DNA, our mission is very clear; we always seek to attract, engage, develop and retain national and expat talent and promote the UAE governments Emiratisation strategy. In fact we remain strong advocates of nationalisation in every GCC country we operate in. So the Global Management Challenge provides Al-Futtaim Automotive with a solid innovative platform for talent engagement here at home today and also elsewhere in the region in the future.
The first round of the competition started on the day of the launch event and will last five weeks. Registered teams are placed in groups comprising up to eight teams per group with the winning team or teams in each group proceeding to the second round which lasts for three weeks. The winning team in each group of the second round proceeds to the UAE final to be held on 12th March 2016 which determines the UAE champion that will go on to represent the nation at the international final in Macau.
To reinforce the core value of learning by doing which is an integral pillar of the Global Management Challenge, Al-Futtaim Automotive will provide specialist Masterclasses and will leverage some of their existing partners to provide a global best practice trip that demonstrates high levels of excellence. This learning experience entails a visit to a prestigious university and a globally recognised automotive brand for targeted and immersive sessions designed to improve understanding of business processes, challenges and opportunities within real life environments leading to globally recognised industry benchmarks.

Toyota Rush makes a new beginning in the UAE: Authentic small SUV designed for an active lifestyle
MAY 17, 2018 Al-Futtaim Toyota welcomes Rush, a new versatile 7-seater SUV into the Toyota line-up , designed for those looking for the functionality and space of a large SUV as well upgraded lifestyle and affordability of a small SUV.
Carving itself a niche in the growing small SUV segment, Rush enjoys a unique offering, as it combines the space and solid road performance of a large SUV, with top level-leading fuel economy performance, and Toyota-guaranteed dependability, all packaged in a stylishly designed body.
Crossover utility vehicles and compact SUVs represent the fastest growing segment in the global automotive industry. In our region, this category of vehicles has been on a steady growth trend since 2013, and is expected to steer in the same direction in the coming years, accounting for 25% of the total SUV market in the UAE. This growth is mainly driven by customers who want more lifestyle-oriented vehicles, affording them all the benefits of an SUV such as styling and higher seating position, at a similar price of a passenger car, said Saud Abbasi, Managing Director of Al-Futtaim Toyota at the car launch event.
Design and Roominess Toyota Rush features a dynamic, high-end design appropriate to an SUV, presented in a bold shape with sophisticated three-dimensional lines on the sides of the body. The chrome finish on the grille and headlamps enhances the wide, sharp and advanced image of the frontal fascia, giving the car a premium look.
Despite its compact body, the interior of the Rush features high-quality accessories worthy of a class above vehicle for greater SUV enjoyment. With its roomy three-row seating design, Rush is able to accommodate seven adult passengers even when all seats are in use. The double-folding feature on second and third row seats provides easy access for all passengers and ample cargo space when needed.
Dependable Performance and Fuel Economy The designers aimed to create a powerful all-terrain-capable SUV that provides powerful traction on all types of surfaces. With a front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout, and a class-top ground clearance, Rush conquers every terrain while offering ride comfort and quietness and excellent handling stability. The highly rigid body, ample suspension stroke and rear stabilisers ensure the stable steering and ride comfort needed to prevent fatigue on long trips.
Rush is available in a 1.5L in-line 4-cylinder petrol engine with Dual Variable Valve Timing-intelligent (VVT-i), which, along with an optimised combustion chamber and lightweight moving parts, provides enough power and excellent fuel efficiency.
Safety Rush has been given an ample array of safety features to ensure driver and passenger peace of mind. The 5-star ASEAN NCAP-rated collision safety features include a sturdy body structure, SRS driver and front passenger air bags, SRS side air bags and SRS curtain shield air bags.
Vehicle Stability Control and Hill-start Assist Control systems are provided as standard features to help provide safety during routine driving.
Rush is an authentic SUV that Toyota has confidently released in over 100 countries. In the UAE, the new SUV will be available with 17 inch alloy wheels and 5 exterior colour choices, all presented in an unbeatable package of only AED 68,500.

Baia Baia Indonesia has launched its latest collection of personalised sandals at an event in Jakarta at the Grand Indonesia Shopping Town store on January 24, 2018. Inviting a select group of media partners and social media influencers, the casual gathering announced two special collections launched to celebrate the upcoming Valentines Day and the Year of the Dog. The event began with a speech by Menur Dwi Suryandari, Brand Manager of Baia Baia, who thanked guests for taking time out to attend the event and inviting them to explore the store.
The new collection features sandals in different shades of red and love-themed charms, which were available to customers at launch. The inspiration for the latest collection is drawn from popular themes related to those two special occasions and is true to the fabric of the brand which offers customers instant style  and instant joy! Attendees at the event each received a personalised pair of slippers as a representation of their personal style statement.
Baia Baia is a French brand that allows customers to enjoy a do-it-yourself (DIY) experience in creating rubber-soled sandals. What make this boutique concept even more special is the customisation of charm placement on the strap. The charms are basically eye-catching accessories that vary from emoji-inspired shapes to sparkly diamond-like beads.
Al-Futtaim operates Baia Baia across stores in Indonesia and Vietnam. The brands unique style offering is also available within the Robinsons store at Dubai Festival City in the UAE.

Zara has reopened its flagship store in VivoCity, Singapore. This newly refurbished establishment showcases the brands latest global concept with its 2,700 sq. m sales area, approximately doubling the space that it had before the refurbishment. It will be distributed in two stores, with the latest collections of Woman, Basic, TRF, and Kids housed under one roof, and a separate store dedicated to Man.
The store, which features a new interior design, stands out for its facade without windows, which provides a transparent view of the stores architectural features, collections and in-store mannequins. Designed to provide continuous and comfortable light, the back-lit ceiling provides soft ambient lighting which contributes to a sensory shopping experience. The space invites the customer to enjoy an interactive experience with the merchandise like never before.
As an eco-efficient store, it also incorporates the green-building criteria stipulated by Zaras parent group Inditex. The store consumes 20 per cent less energy and 40 per cent less water compared to a conventional store. To ensure that it continues to meet these energy reduction targets, its energy use is regulated by a central control centre at Zaras headquarters in Arteixo, northwest Spain.
As part of Zaras commitment to improve the quality of service and shopping experience for customers, the new store introduces the Groups latest technological developments. This includes radio frequency identification technology (RFID), which helps to track the location of garments quickly and precisely to make the products most in demand by customers rapidly available on the shop floor, ensuring that customers shopping needs are fulfilled.

Hand-picked by Swedish retailer, IKEA, six talented artists and design teams with close links to the fashion industry were chosen to create inspired prints for the launch of the STUNSIG Limited Collection 2017. Featuring everything from fashion photography, digital couture, cartoons to hand drawings and collages, the new collection is applied to everyday items such as cushions, quilt covers, boxes and porcelain.
The result of the collaboration between IKEA and these six artists including Frdrique Vernillet, Malcolm Stuart, Pinar & Viola, Steven Harrington, Team Hawaii and Tilde Bay, is a playful collection, one that stands out from the crowd.
STUNSIG items are able to turn the ordinary into something extraordinary, with modern and artistic vibes merged together. The fun, edgy and sometimes poetic prints evoke a myriad of different reactions and emotions. Some are created just to make you laugh while others are made to stimulate peoples imagination and appreciate the beauty in diversity.
Henrik Most, Creative Leader for STUNSIG, said, With STUNSIG we wanted to present new artistic prints that are more unique, more fun and more daring! And apply them to selected IKEA products, turning them upside down and make them extraordinary.

July 12, 2017 Now more than ever, ease of wear and versatility are key factors when making considered purchases. Even a statement piece needs to work harder, and with the distinction between the seasons continuing to blur, a dress for every occasion is an important wardrobe addition.
The Dress Edit offers a collection of stylish yet versatile pieces that will effortlessly transition from season to season, through subtle style tweaks. The navy flute sleeve and green maxi dress will look chic with sandals and a cross body bag, as well as with a knee-high boot come Autumn. Likewise, the blue dress layered with a polo neck is the perfect day-to-night look for cold evenings, or it can be teamed with gold accessories and elegant flats, for Summer afternoons.
The floral V-Neck dress, offers another take on the classic dress. Wear on its own for a bold aesthetic, or team the dress with an elegant basic, to anchor a series of stylish looks.
Timing is also key; as well as aligning the excitement of a media event with the customer experience by offering a collection to buy now; the Dress Edit also directly responds to what the customer is looking for, and when.
Marks & Spencer sells on average 1.6 million dresses a year, by listening to extensive feedback and evaluating shopping habits, we know that during June dresses are top of the style agenda; with seasonal events like weddings and summer holidays tipping the scale. Online searches for dresses also start to peak during this month, therefore by offering the Dress Edit, Marks & Spencer are directly responding to what the customer wants, at the time when she needs it most.

Al-Futtaim Motors and dnata invest in eco-efficient transport solutions
AUGUST 28, 2017
Al-Futtaim Motors, leader in sustainable mobility and exclusive distributor of Toyota, Lexus, Hino and Toyota Material Handling in the UAE, and dnata, part of the Emirates Group and the worlds largest air services providers, have reiterated a commitment to a more sustainable future by introducing a fleet of hybrid vehicles.
The new hybrid fleet includes Lexus RX 450h, Toyota Prius, the new Hino 300 Series hybrid truck as well as electric towing trucks from Toyota Material Handling, all designed to meet the demanding requirements of dnata while maintaining a low ecological footprint.
dnata has been in the UAE practically as long as Al-Futtaim Motors, and both companies share an innate desire to contribute more to the society by providing services that will help build a greener future for upcoming generations, said Bertrand Thiebaut, Senior Managing Director of Al-Futtaim Motors.
For more than seven years, Lexus has paved the path for hybrid transport in the UAE, and we now offer the largest choice of luxury hybrid vehicles to consumers and businesses. This collaboration is testament to our growing portfolio of strategic tie-ups across the UAE, as we continue to supply the best green products from across our brands to suit a wide range of needs. We look forward to seeing our hybrid vehicles deliver dnatas green transport targets.
Gary Chapman, President Emirates Group Services & dnata, said: We have been committed to environmental awareness for quite some time, having been involved in many conservation projects at home and abroad. In our search for the best vehicles to cater to the services of the worlds busiest airport, Al-Futtaim Motors proved that they are able to meet our requirements on several fronts, all while we work tirelessly to significantly decrease our emissions through greener transport solutions across the business.
The Toyota Prius was the worlds first mass-produced hybrid vehicle (petrol-electric) when initially launched in 1997, and has since sold over 3.7 million cars around the globe. The new 2017 Prius employs a petrol engine and an electric motor, and can be powered by the engine, the electric motor or a combination of both, automatically choosing the most efficient mode for the best mileage and lowest emissions. The Prius also features enhanced safety in a more compact package that is lighter in weight with world class aerodynamic, delivering an enhanced fuel efficiency of 26.1 Km/L.
The 2017 RX450 hybrid offers an advanced redesigned hybrid powertrain, sophisticated safety technologies including the new Lexus Safety System+, driver aids, new convenience and technology features that make it the best Lexus sport-utility vehicle ever offered to date. It comes equipped with a 3.5-liter, V-6 petrol engine and revised hybrid powertrain components producing 308 horsepower. The all-new RX 450h is considered the best-selling model in the brands 26-year history with global sales of more than 2.1 million units.
The Hino 300 Series Hybrid light-duty truck features the worlds first hybrid diesel engine designed to deliver cleaner, more efficient transport solutions. Like the conventional petrol-engine Hino light-duty trucks, the hybrid variant is totally customizable and can be used with mounted chiller body, freezer body or dry cargo box, making it the ideal environmentally friendly transport solution for cold chain and cold storage services.

Al-Futtaim Honda launches new CBR1000RR
SEPTEMBER 26, 2017 Al-Futtaim Honda, exclusive distributor of Honda cars, bikes, marine engines and power products in the UAE, has launched the CBR1000RR in the region.
First introduced in 1992, Hondas largest CBR has continuously reset expectations of what an open-class sport bike should be, with a holistic Total Control design approach that focuses on cornering, acceleration and braking.
That practice is taken to the next level with the 25th anniversary CBR1000RR SP, which is also fully loaded with a cutting-edge electronics package. The result is a machine that is underpinned by the Next Stage Total Control concept, with nimble handling and amazing acceleration.
Since their debut, the CBR bikes have been designed to perform in the real world, the way real customers use them, said Yolanda Delport, General Manager  Marketing at Al-Futtaim Honda.
Were pleased to launch the 2017 CBR1000RR SP, which follows in that same tradition by providing a superbly balanced package with Hondas best power-to-weight ratio ever. It works incredibly well on track and, even more importantly, is both exhilarating and uniquely rewarding to ride out on the open road, she added.
The CBR1000RR SP has received a vast array of improvements, including some that come straight from the RC213V-S. Electronics play a big role, including semi-active hlins Electronic Control suspension (S-EC), plus a number of rider aids built around the five-axis Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU).
Power and torque have been increased through a higher compression ratio and revised cam timing, while ample use of magnesium (engine covers) and titanium (muffler andfor the first time on a mass-production road bikefuel tank) have reduced weight and improved mass centralisation. The twin-spar aluminum frames rigidity balance has been finely adjusted, and the swingarm is stiffer. Brembo monobloc four-piston front brake calipers use high-performance track-ready brake pads, while a narrower radiator and new bodywork achieve a slimmer profile.
The CBR1000RR is available for AED 67,900 and the CBR1000RR SP for AED 77,900 across all Al-Futtaim Honda showrooms in the UAE.

Al-Futtaim Motors showcases Toyotas Zero-Emissions vehicle at WETEX
OCTOBER 24, 2017 Coming on the heels of the inauguration of the 1st hydrogen station that enables the usage of Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles (FCEVs) in the UAE, and in line with its commitment to support the environmental targets of the UAE Vision 2021, Al-Futtaim Motors, leader in sustainable mobility since 2008 and exclusive distributor of Toyota in the UAE, showcased its latest hydrogen-based zero emissions technology, at the 2017 Water, Energy, Technology, and Environment Exhibition (WETEX) through a display of Toyota Mirai, the first Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle in the country.
Running on hydrogen that converts into electricity inside the Mirais fuel cell stack, the car delivers a performance that competes with traditional petrol engine cars, does not require external electric charging, can be refilled with hydrogen in less than 5 minutes and is able to travel up to 500km+ on a full tank, all while emitting nothing but water vapor from the tailpipe. In the onboard Fuel Cell Stack, hydrogen combines with oxygen in the air to generate electricity that powers the vehicles electric motor.
Unlike battery-powered cars, FCEVs can run for long mileage and can be refilled fairly quickly, in a way that does not compromise the drivers behavior in any way. Once deployed on a larger scale, the Fuel Cell Electric technology has the potential to significantly reduce the UAEs dependence on oil and dramatically lower car-generated pollution levels, says Saud Abbasi, Managing Director of Toyota at Al-Futtaim Motors.
Al-Futtaim Motors, in collaboration with Air Liquide, one of the most established suppliers of hydrogen stations in the world, had jointly inaugurated the UAEs first hydrogen station in Dubai Festival City earlier in October, to facilitate the usage of Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles.
This development came following the announcement made at the Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week earlier this year where Toyotas Chairman, Takeshi Uchiyamada, launched a collaborative study about the feasibility of establishing a hydrogen-based society in the UAE, aiming at drastically lowering CO2 emissions, in line with the UAE Vision 2021.

Reach the unreachable with the new 2018 Toyota Land Cruiser Prado
OCTOBER 17, 2017 Continuing the legacy of the powerful four-wheel drive performance and unrivaled off-road capabilities, the new 2018 Land Cruiser Prado has been officially launched by Al-Futtaim Motors, leader in sustainable mobility since 2008 and exclusive distributor of Toyota in the UAE. The new Prado comes with a more robust exterior, sophisticated and intuitive interior design in addition to improved driving abilities and user-friendliness, both on- and off-road, cementing its reputation as one of the worlds toughest and most reliable SUVs.
Saud Abbasi, Managing Director of Toyota at Al-Futtaim Motors said: Land Cruiser Prado has maintained its leadership of the Midsize SUV category with 25% market share of the segment, making it by far one of our best performing vehicles. The new Prados advanced robustness, expressed through its modern styling and cutting-edge technology, and reliable performance make it not only a prime choice for families and off-roaders, but also a favorite model among many fleet operators, thanks to its high quality, durability and reliability and low total cost of ownership.
More Dynamic, Modern and Robust Styling
The exterior design of successive Prado generations has always combined stylish aesthetics with the robust image of durability and power expected from a genuine four-wheel drive machine.
The new Prado builds on this proven and trusted formula with a unique design which is visually more agile and dynamic, yet maintains three core strengths essential to the vehicles renowned go-anywhere credentials, namely, Total Practicality Total Durability and Total Capability .
With the newly designed bonnet, radiator grille, headlamps, front bumper and fenders, the front of the Prado draws on several structural elements from its unique design heritage.
Organized into a powerful, single graphic form, the radiator grille and headlamps have been placed high for greater off-road functionality. The grille openings are as large as possible to allow for optimum engine cooling performance, while the headlamp main beams are positioned inboard to avoid damage from obstacles during off-road driving.
In keeping with the Prado heritage, the grille features broad vertical bars with slit-shaped cooling openings finished in chrome. Integrating high and low beams, a front turn signal lamp and Daytime Running Lights (DRL) within a distinctive casing, the headlamp clusters may be equipped with either halogen or LED/halogen headlamps, the latter incorporating LED DRL.
In profile, the front bumper peak has been raised, and the bonnet, fender line, front bumper and rear bumper are now aligned on the same horizontal axis, giving the new Prado a more athletic and dynamic posture. The vehicle profile is further enhanced by a choice of six-spoke 17 alloys, or a high gloss painted 18 alloy wheel.
Looking at the Prado from the back, new rear elements now include a redesigned lamp cluster featuring an LED stop light, a smaller rear garnish plate incorporated within the number plate surround and a restyled bumper with a kicked-up base to the protruding corners.
Sophisticated and Intuitive Interior
Combining improved operability with refined finish, the interior of the new Prado features revised dashboard styling that incorporates new designs for the drivers instrument panel and center console.
The top of the new center console tower has been lowered for a sleeker appearance and improved front visibility when driving off-road.
In the redesigned, four-gauge drivers instrument binnacle, the precision Optitron meters feature a metallic base panel and spin-polished dials with raised scale markings. They flank a 4.2 TFT color Multi-Information Display* which provides drivers with a comprehensive vehicle and infotainment data. Controlled via steering wheel mounted switchgear, the display features on-screen content including driving, vehicle, navigation, audio, driver assistance and warning message information.
The heightened luxury and sophistication of the new interior design have been further enhanced by new, white illumination for the instrument panel, center console and door switchgear. A new interior lighting scheme incorporates LED front footwell, glove box lamps, and door panel illumination for high-quality cabin ambiance.
A high-definition 9-inch full-color multimedia screen enables centralized control of navigation and audiovisual systems which complements the rearview monitor to guide the driver while backing up the car. In addition to AM/FM radio and a DVD player, the JBL system* optimally positions 14 speakers through the cabin, creating a quality sound space. The amplifier is compatible with Clari-Fi, a compressed audio restoration technology that helps play the music as close to its original audio quality by recreating the high-range and low-range sounds, as well as sounds of the natural vocal and stereo feelings that are usually suppressed when saving files in the MP3 format.
The system also features Bluetooth support and has USB and mini-jack inputs offering external audio input, enabling the driver and passengers to easily connect playback devices to enjoy their favorite music. Rear seat passengers can also enjoy video from DVDs, Blu-ray discs and other sources on the large, retractable 9-inch LCD monitor.
As for the front seats, the driver seat is equipped with 8-way power seat along with power lumbar support, and the front passenger seat is available with 4-way power seat. The 2nd-row seat there has a 40:20:40 split-folding, sliding and reclining configuration. The 3rd-row 50:50 split seats are powered and can be easily operated either from inside the car or from the back door.
Storage points are provided all around the cabin. Front seat storage includes a capacious glove box, overhead sunglasses holder (with built-in conversation mirror), two cup holders, and large front door pockets with built-in bottle holders. There is also a large storage box, available with cooling function, under the center console armrest and is big enough to hold four half-liter bottles and fitted with an upper-level tray. Second-row passengers are served by seatback pockets, center armrest twin cup holders and door pockets with bottle holders. Cup holders are provided for third-row occupants, too. Twelve-volt power outlets are provided in the front and second rows, with a 220V AC power outlet in the load space.
But thats not all when we talk about storage, as the powered third-row seats have under-floor storage function giving the Prado extra load capacity. A toolbox is stowed in a purpose-designed compartment in the tailgate.
The air conditioning for the Prado is designed to maintain peak performance even when the vehicle is being driven in extreme climates. The fully-automatic system provides triple-zone, independent temperature control.
Powerful Engine and Superior Driving Dynamics
The new Prado is available in two engine options including a 4-cylinder 2.7-liter in-line 16-valve DOHC format with VVT-i producing 164 hp and up to 25.1 kg-m and a V6 engine 4.0-liter 24-valve DOHC with dual VVT-I producing 271 hp and up to 38.9 kg-m.
Both petrol engines are mated with a 6-speed Super-Intelligent Electronically-controlled automatic transmission with multi-mode sequential shift mode that allows the driver to select gears manually, making it ideal for added control in challenging weather conditions.
In addition to a solid engine profile, the new Prado comes with a series of advanced dynamic and handling features that highlight its reputation as one of the most technically-advanced four-wheel drive vehicles, including the newly-developed full-time four-wheel drive with TORSEN limited slip differential (LSD), which allocates optimal driver power distribution to the left and right wheels in response to various driving scenarios, including straight-line driving and cornering. The system helps achieve outstanding straight-line stability and cornering performance. An additional central differential lock is also available, thereby increasing stability especially in extreme off-road conditions and terrains.
The new Prado comes with Drive Mode Select*, allowing the driver to tailor powertrain and suspension responses by selecting drive modes suitable for the situation, or to match their preferred driving style, thus heightening driving pleasure. Modes include NORMAL, which realizes an excellent balance between driving performance and fuel economy that suits a wide variety of driving scenes; ECO mode adjusts powertrain responses and air conditioning to prioritize fuel-efficient driving; while in the SPORT mode, the Variable Flow Control (VFC) and powertrain components, such as the engine and transmission, are controlled. This provides enhanced accelerator response and a more dynamic and powerful feel of acceleration.
The Crawl Control System* helps maintain a low uniform vehicle speed by automatically controlling the engine output and hydraulic brake pressure to reduce driver burden during off-road driving. This system works on rough off-road terrains and slippery surfaces by moderating the accelerator and brake operations, leaving the driver with complete focus on steering the vehicle. The smooth control minimizes wheel spin and wheel lock-up, ensuring vehicle stability even on slippery surfaces. The Crawl Control System has five adjustable speed levels that can be selected to match the terrain.
Multi-Terrain Select (MTS)* automatically modifies vehicle acceleration, braking, and traction control to suit off-road conditions, providing the driver with optimum traction and vehicle control on five terrain modes: Rock, Rock & Dirt, Mogul, Loose Rock, and Mud & Sand. There is also an Auto mode to optimize car-control according to the preset vehicle speed set on the Crawl Control. The selected mode is displayed on the multimedia screen, along with an additional prompt for the driver to engage the appropriate H4 or L4 four-wheel drive transfer range.
Other features include a Multi-Terrain Monitor* is used in conjunction with MTS to help the driver confirm their surroundings when driving off-road. The driver can select a view from the front, side, and rear cameras to conveniently check the vehicles blind spots and immediate surroundings. The MTS includes Underfloor View and Panoramic View to help the driver visually confirm the area under, in the front, and on the sides of the vehicle.
Adding to the versatility of the Prado is the Hill-start Assist Control (HAC) system which prevents vehicle roll-back when stopping and then starting again on a steep incline or slippery surface. In addition, the Downhill Assist Control (DAC) feature improves directional control during descent on steep or slippery surfaces.
Prados front independent double wishbone and rear four-link rigid suspension offer greater ride comfort and better steering feel. Further enhancing the ride experience, the electrically-controlled Kinetic Dynamic Suspension System (KDSS)*, that is available on Limited, optimizes the effect of the front and rear anti-roll bars for better on- and off-road performance. When driving on the road, the system works to suppress body roll, improve steering response and absorb the effects of driving over poor road surfaces. During off-road conditions, all tires are kept firmly in contact with the ground even when crossing over rocks and other rough surfaces so that drivers can enjoy a stable ride with excellent traction for superior rough-terrain driveability and control.
The new Prados Tire Pressure Warning System detects low tire pressure and displays a warning on the Multi-Information Display in real time. Hence, insufficient tire pressure can be determined at a glance, and pressure refill or tire replacement can be performed with accurate and timely information.
Upgraded Safety Technologies
The Prado is as reliable as it looks with a body structure that is crafted with high-tensile steel with the latest safety technologies and innovative systems offer exceptional levels of safety and security. For instance, a multi-terrain Anti-Lock Braking System (ABS) automatically adapts braking performance to suit the surface on which the vehicle is traveling, while the Electronic Brake-force Distribution (EBD) feature balances braking forces between the front and rear brakes in accordance with driving conditions and vehicle load. This is further supported by Brake Assist (BA) that provides auxiliary force to assist the driver during emergency braking. The Vehicle Stability Control (VSC) system ensures stability by automatically adjusting engine output and the braking force of each wheel when the vehicle experiences oversteer or understeer during cornering or driving on slippery road surfaces.
To ensure the safety of pedestrians and make roads a safe space for all, the Prado has a Pedestrian Protection through Impact Alleviation Structure, an impact-absorbing structure of the hood, fenders, and other components, which helps enhance pedestrian protection performance. Furthermore, seatbelt pre-tensioners and force-limiters are adopted for the driver and front passenger seats, while Three-point Automatic Locking Retractor/Emergency Locking Retractor (ALR/ELR) seatbelts and Three-point Emergency Locking Retractor (ELR) seatbelts are adopted for the second and third-row seats respectively.
The Prado is equipped with a total of seven airbags: drivers dual-stage front airbag, drivers knee airbag, passengers front airbag, front side airbags, and full-length curtain airbags, giving head protection to outer seat occupants in all three rows.
A Blind Spot Monitor (BSM) and Rear Cross Traffic Alert (RCTA) * are also there to alert the driver of nearby vehicles traveling in the Prados blind spot by lighting up an indicator on the surface of the door mirror. The Rear Cross Traffic Alert (RCTA) feature uses the same radar to warn the driver of any vehicles approaching from either side that may not be visible through the rear screen or door mirrors. If a vehicle is detected, the system flashes warning lights in the door mirrors and sounds a warning buzzer.
While all Prado grades come with a rear-view camera that helps the driver secure his way while reversing, the Prado Limited comes fitted with a Rear-View Monitor System displaying 360 degrees video images of objects behind the vehicle to enhance the visibility of the driver when backing up. There is also a Front and Back Clearance Sonar that displays a warning message and sets off a buzzer on the 4.2-inch color TFT Multi-Information Display, further assisting the driver in detecting the presence of obstacles when maneuvering the vehicle in tight areas and when parking it.
In order to make it more appealing and suitable for all those who desire joining the Prado family, the 2018 model is now available in 4 grades/ 8 derivatives to choose from.
3-door 2.7 L GXR starting at AED 129,900 5-door 2.7L engine, coming in EXR for AED 129,900, GXR for AED 144,900 and VXR for AED 159,900 5-door 4.0L engine available in EXR for 159,900, GXR for AED 179,900, VXR for AED 194,900 and now an even more exclusive grade the Limited priced at AED 204,900 which comes fitted with leather beige interior

Al-Futtaim Motors and Air Liquide officially inaugurate first hydrogen station for Fuel Cell Electric vehicles in the UAE
OCTOBER 11, 2017 Al-Futtaim Motors, leader in sustainable mobility and exclusive distributor of Toyota in the UAE, in collaboration with Air Liquide, one of the most established suppliers of hydrogen stations in the world, have jointly inaugurated the UAEs first hydrogen station in Dubai Festival City, to be used by Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles (FCEVs).
The new facility comes following the announcement made at the Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week earlier this year where Toyotas Chairman, Takeshi Uchiyamada, announced the launch of a collaborative study about the feasibility of establishing a hydrogen-based society in the UAE, aiming at drastically lowering CO2 emissions, in line with the UAE Vision 2021.
The new Al Badia-based hydrogen station will enable larger-scale deployment of Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles as part of a pilot program which started in May 2017, aiming at testing the zero-emission FCEV technology on UAE roads.
Using cutting-edge technologies, such as Toyotas proven electric propulsion system also available in hybrid cars, FCEVs such as the Toyota Mirai, run on hydrogen rather than petrol, emitting only water from the tail pipe. In the onboard Fuel Cell Stack, hydrogen combines with oxygen in the air to generate electricity that powers the vehicles electric motor.
Bertrand Thiebaut, Senior Managing Director, Al-Futtaim Motors and Senior Vice President Al-Futtaim Automotive Group said: The pilot which started with only three Toyota Mirai vehicles, will soon expand to involve a larger fleet that will be tested by key stakeholders in the UAE. With the inauguration of the UAEs first hydrogen station in partnership with Air Liquide, we are one step closer to a low-carbon society, as we work towards a concrete contribution to a cleaner air, in line with the Governments green agenda.
Also speaking at the event, Matthieu Giard, Dubai Hub Executive Vice President for Africa, Middle East and India at Air Liquide, explained the potential of hydrogen for a cleaner transport solution: Air Liquide is developing clean transport solutions to help reduce the environmental footprint. Hydrogen is a key enabler for an effective transition to a low-carbon economy aiming at improving air quality in our cities. This first hydrogen station installed in partnership with Al-Futtaim Motors in the UAE is a first step for a large-scale deployment of hydrogen energy in this region. We are proud to bring our expertise and technology to create a more sustainable society, allowing all parties to contribute to meeting energy and environmental targets.
Unlike battery-powered electric vehicles, the Toyota Mirai delivers a performance that competes with traditional petrol engine cars, does not require external electric charging, can be refilled with hydrogen in less than 5 minutes and is able to travel up to 500km+ on a full tank. Once deployed on a larger scale, the Fuel Cell Electric technology has the potential to significantly reduce the UAEs dependence on oil and lower car-generated pollution levels.

Toyotas stand will not only showcase what is new and improved, but will be able to share with the public its vision for a cleaner, more sustainable future, in line with Toyotas 2050 Environmental Challenge and the UAE Vision 2021 said Saud Abbasi, Managing Director of Toyota at Al-Futtaim Motors.
Toyota will be dedicating the largest part of its stand to zero-emission Fuel Cell Electric technology and hybrid motoring, in order to help raise awareness about the various benefits these technologies can bring to the environment.
The Dubai International Motor Show is a great platform for Toyota to educate the public about means its latest vehicles and technologies, are contributing to drastically reducing emissions and promoting greener mobility through hybrid electric and Fuel Cell electric vehicles, continued Abbasi.
While the outdoor stand is just outside the main entrance of the Dubai International Trade Centre, the indoor stand is in Hall 3, stand 315.

UNIVERSAL AMERICAN SCHOOL
Buy Now
Back to Real Estate
An American Curriculum and IB World School
Owned and operated by Al Futtaim Education Foundation, Universal American School is an American curriculum and IB World School, operating as not-for-profit in the heart of family friendly Festival City.
Universal American School was founded in 2005. Since then they have served students every day, helping them become compassionate, confident learners who know who they are and what they stand for. There is a wonderful feeling about this school which comes from their mission:
To Nurture a Community of Integrity and Academic Excellence
Universal American School is deeply committed to providing students opportunities to identify and achieve a personal best in everything they do. Whether it be through their innovative and future focused integration of learning technology, their creative arts program, the sports and athletics programming, or through their various opportunities for student advocacy and student agency. Universal American School students know that they matter and belong in our learning community.
This is an American international school that adds value to the already rich and challenging International Baccalaureate (IB) curriculum framework. They emphasize the importance of well- being and purpose through relationship building. This is highlighted by their comprehensive student support services as well as through their business partnerships and commitment to developing internship opportunities with Al-Futtaim.
Starting in 2019-20, alongside the IB Diploma Programme and our general High School courses (based on AERO/Common Core Plus standards), UAS introduced a selection of Advanced Placement (AP) courses for students in Grades 11 and 12. This parallel track empowers students to make more personalized choices in their education. Moreover, it serves as an opportunity for students to seek alternate routes to post-secondary education.
Students dont really leave UAS. Rather, they move on with two pieces of paper in their hands. One that says they have accomplished something they are very proud of, and another that says they are going somewhere they want to be. Universal American School knows this because every year, many of their students return to school from their next adventure; appreciating that Universal American School have helped them become the best possible version of who they already were.

Al-Futtaim Education Foundation Hosts Conference Celebrating UAEs Passion for Arabic
The Centre for Excellence in Arabic at Al Futtaim Education Foundation hosted its first annual conference under the banner: Re-igniting the Passion and Education Futures, on 9th and 10th November at the Intercontinental Hotel in Dubai Festival City.
The Conference, aimed at Arabic teachers within Dubai and beyond, brought together educators, musicians, calligraphers, teachers, students, renowned poets, intellectuals and Arabic language enthusiasts in an event dedicated to celebrating the passion for Arabic, with all its art forms. The official opening ceremony held under the patronage of Mr Omar Al Futtaim, Vice Chairman of Al Futtaim Group and Chairman of Al Futtaim Education Foundation Board, was attended by their excellencies Hussain Lootah, Mohammed Al Murr and Abdullah Al Tarifi, and focused on presenting Arabic as a language of thought, of literature, of the workplace, of science and of life.
Speaking at the opening ceremony, Mr Fadi Hammadeh, Al Futtaim Education Foundation Board Member, said: Al Futtaim Education Foundation is an initiative launched by Al-Futtaim Group to support our students, teachers and the community. The Foundation, which operates on a not-for-profit basis, works on spreading the values of tolerant education, on preparing students for the future and on pursuing excellence in all its endeavours. Mr Hammadeh added: The Centre for Excellence in Arabic has at the very core of its objectives updating and enhancing Arabic education within our schools through relevant, modern and engaging content in addition to training and supporting outstanding and passionate teachers.
Highlighting the need for action that stems from an accurate reading of the international school educational scene in the UAE, Mrs Mira Al Futtaim, Member of Al Futtaim Education Board, noted that students needed the time and the space to enhance and improve their Arabic language skills, particularly in relation to speaking Arabic fluently and confidently. Mrs Al Futtaim asserted, however, that this was only a temporary reality, that we would work on changing.
Re-igniting the Passion Conference also presented student views on Arabic and on what can be done to make it more relatable and in keeping with the age in which we live. A is for Arabic Action was the title of a segment presented by students from Deira International School and Universal American School in which students addressed the audience calling upon them to frame Arabic in the here and now. Students expressed their dismay that much of the content in Arabic can be archaic and irrelevant. The poet Farah Chamma, who is a product of the international school system in Dubai, gave an impassioned performance of some of her poems, which were written in the 21st century and for a 21st century audience.

Dubai Festival City Mall Partners With Spotify To Launch Music Library in Industry First
Dubai, United Arab Emirates, 15th July 2019: In a world first, Dubai Festival City Mall has launched its own music library which will be available on multiple music platforms, becoming the only mall globally to offer such a service. The worlds most popular streaming service, Spotify, will be one of the first platforms to offer music fans access to stream songs and albums from IMAGINE, the two-time record-breaking visual and sensory show.
Dubai, United Arab Emirates, 15th July 2019:
IMAGINE, which plays live every night on the iconic Festival Bay and is free for all visitors, combines lasers, light, fire and water to tell remarkable, emotive stories. The state-of-the-art show seamlessly fuses technology and art and has earned two Guinness World Records for the largest water screen projection and the largest permanent projection mapping.
Each IMAGINE show has an original soundtrack, created with world-class conductors, producers and orchestras. The request to access and stream the soundtrack at any given time was a direct response from customers.
Customers were watching our shows and asking, I cant seem to find this song on Spotify, and we realised there was an important opportunity to connect with our customers through the music of the IMAGINE Show, said Steven Cleaver, Director of Malls Dubai.
Spotify launched in MENA last year with a full Arabic service, dozens of locally-curated playlists for every mood and moment, and access to a full catalogue of millions of songs, for both free and premium users. The service is available in 13 markets in the MENA region, with a global presence in 79 markets.
Our focus at Dubai Festival City Mall has always been creating exceptional experiences for our visitors. The launch of our own music library today is a true manifesto of that promise and demonstrates how we are once again leading the industry, said Timothy Earnest, Group Director, Al-Futtaim Malls.
This is one of the main reasons we wanted to partner with Spotify as they share our values of being innovators in their space. Launching a music library allows customers to extend the experience long after they have left the mall and we expect to see similar developments across the industry.
Managing Director MEA, Claudius Boller at Spotify said, Spotify helps music fans enjoy, discover and share new music from both local and international artists simply and easily. We are delighted to add the IMAGINE music catalogue to our library to enable music fans to relive the experience over and over again.
The IMAGINE soundtracks are available now via https://open.spotify.com/album/0Wl0XZSkcsmcATPExjeJOS?si=4gIAPuORR-uvnyF_mQv-Iw

Al-Futtaim Motors launches 2016 Toyota Fortuner with added style and legendary off-road capability
Al-Futtaim Motors has launched the second generation of the highly popular Toyota Fortuner seven-seat SUV, featuring fully redesigned exterior and interior styling, coupled with legendary off-road performance synonymous with Toyota SUVs.
Renowned for its durability, on-road comfort and off-road prowess, the new Fortuner features a more distinctive, sleek and powerful design with improved driving dynamics and fuel consumption, as well as a wide variety of features for additional convenience, safety and ride comfort.
Saud Abbasi, Managing Director of Toyota at Al-Futtaim Motors said during the launch: The medium SUV segment constitutes 46 per cent of the volume SUV market in the UAE and the Fortuner has played a major role in maintaining Toyotas leadership of this segment in the past five years. For the last ten years the Fortuner has catered to a very specific demographic in the SUV market.
Thanks to its excellent capability on and off-road, good fuel economy and versatility, the car has always been considered as the ideal commuting vehicle for medium to large families, with two or more children. With the new enhancements, we believe the car will not only continue to appeal to these families but will even see an increased interest among young Emiratis and Westerners looking for a strong SUV that can combine unbeatable off-road capabilities with premium looking interior, he continued.
The new Fortuner is available in eight exterior colours across all Al-Futtaim Motors showrooms, with prices starting at AED 105,900 for the 2.7L EXR, and AED 127,900 for the 4.0L GXR and AED 139,900 for the top of the line 4.0L VXR.

Deira International Schools efforts in providing outstanding pastoral care for its Year Six students have been internationally recognised at the British International School Awards (BISA), the inaugural awards ceremony developed by British International Schools magazine.
The Pastoral Care Initiative award recognises a schools efforts to support pupils wellbeing, and the judges conferred the award to Deira International School for its effectiveness, sustainability and success in easing the transition of Year Six students from Primary to Secondary school life.
The school identified the need to develop a unique hybrid transitional structure that would allow both Primary and Secondary teaching , learning and pastoral strategies to complement each other over a full academic year for its students in Year Six. The students begin the year located in the Secondary building on the schools Dubai Festival City campus, with the familiar routine and expected behaviours of Primary Key Stage 2; by the third term, they are fully integrated into Secondary school life, avoiding the immediacy of a transition which can impact on students academic and social performance.
The year group now falls in line with the British Curriculums Primary assessment cycle to ensure continuity throughout Key Stage 2 whilst providing rigorous and robust assessment data for the schools Secondary Leaders, resulting in greater collaboration, consultation and sharing of good practice. Following implementation of this transitional structure, the school has also received an Outstanding rating for its pastoral care from the Knowledge and Human Development Authority of Dubai.
Ian Ward said: This unique approach has had such a positive impact on our students achievements both academically and pastorally, they truly are Secondary ready. The teachers have really embraced this programme and all their efforts have been rewarded by winning such a prestigious award.
The BISA Pastoral Care Initiative award was presented to Ian Ward, Primary School Principal, Deira International School, at an awards ceremony in London on 23 rd January.
Pictured here are, from left to right, Mike Orr, Year 6 Teacher, Jacqui Visser, Year 6 Teacher, Jeff Smith, Director, Natasha Higman Year 5 and 6 Phase Leader, Sarah Hoodless Head of Year 6 and Ian Ward, Primary Principal.

Marks & Spencer launches new LIFE. SPEND IT WELL campaign in the Gulf
British retailer Marks & Spencer today announces the launch of its new brand proposition in the Middle East: Life. Spend it Well.
More than just a tagline, Life. Spend it Well is an attitude  designed to inspire and enable people to make every moment special by focusing on the quality experiences, people and things that really matter. The new advertising campaign will sit across all digital channels, in-store and all Marks & Spencer marketing communications in the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Egypt, Kuwait, Oman, Lebanon and Qatar moving forward.
Life. Spend it Well is based on the insight that, people increasingly seek out what is important: the quality experiences, people and things that make life special. Marks & Spencer exists to help its customers make the most out of every moment and every minute. Life. Spend it Well is about wearing your best coat, breaking out the biscuits and saying no to food that doesnt take you to extraordinary places.
In a social media first launch, the 60-second Life. Spend it Well ad  https://we.tl/Nd4aaxOPQj  will premiere tomorrow, Friday 5th May, across digital and social.
The bold advert takes customers on a journey from cradle to graceful (or not-so-graceful) empowerment, reminding every woman and every generation that life is short, so spend it well. A series of uplifting vignettes featuring women of all ages celebrate the power of everyday choices. These choices range from the practical to the emotional, with viewers urged to say no to regrets and no to comparing yourself to others.
The launch of this campaign introduces an inspirational tone of voice for the brand, and focuses on attitude and empowerment. It represents a commitment to putting the consumer at the heart of everything it does  positioning Marks & Spencer as enabler of a life well-lived  and includes a significant focus on customer experience.
The new advertising campaign is the first from Valenstein & Fatt (the creative agency formerly known as Grey London). The advert was directed by Franois Rousselet through Riff Raff Films, and, fittingly, set against a new arrangement of David Bowies classic Rebel Rebel.
Patrick Bousquet-Chavanne, Marks & Spencers Executive Director of Customer, Marketing & M&S.com said: Our Life. Spend it Well campaign is a radical departure from where weve been previously. It speaks to deep truths about our customers and celebrates their lives in a way which is new and innovative for the brand. To remain relevant and attract new customers, we need to get people thinking differently about Marks & Spencer and recapture our position as a pioneer in culture.
Thats why the energy, swagger and spirit of Life. Spend it Well is so important  its about empowering our customers to say no to the ordinary, so you can say yes to the best. Were committed to helping our customers spend their lives well by creating and curating the worlds finest, freshest and most inspiring food, by understanding what clothing fits and flatters todays modern woman, and by ensuring this philosophy is applied across the entire customer experience.
The new advert is part of an integrated campaign in the Middle East including digital, social, press, in mall, outdoor and in-store activation from 10th May.
